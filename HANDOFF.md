# Handoff Document - Zwift Race Finder

## Current State (2025-01-06)

### Latest Session Update (Evening)
1. **Continued Refactoring Event Display**
   - Extracted `prepare_event_row` and `EventTableRow` struct from main.rs to event_display.rs
   - Extracted `print_events_table` function from main.rs to event_display.rs
   - All display functions now properly modularized
   - Code compiles and builds successfully

2. **Mutation Testing Progress**
   - 300+ missed mutations identified and being processed
   - Key patterns: arithmetic operator replacements, comparison operators, early returns
   - Tests passing but mutation testing revealing coverage gaps

### What Changed Today

#### Morning Session
- Installed Rust refactoring tools (cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete) ✅
- Created comprehensive Rust refactoring documentation ✅
- Extracted magic numbers into constants module (src/constants.rs) ✅
- Created migration plan for uom crate (MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md) ✅
- Fixed several code quality issues (unused deps, literals, Default impls) ✅

#### Afternoon Session - Code Organization
1. **Refactored Event Display Logic**
   - Extracted 329-line `print_event` function from main.rs into event_display.rs module
   - Broke down into smaller, focused functions:
     - `display_event_header()`, `display_route_info()`, `display_duration_info()`
     - `display_category_enforcement()`, `display_subgroups()`, `display_description_info()`
   - Fixed imports and compilation issues

2. **Test Organization**
   - Moved 6 duration estimation tests from main.rs to duration_estimation.rs
   - Fixed edge case test bug (0.1km with 1m elevation)
   - Created TEST_ORGANIZATION.md documenting test structure
   - Created TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md documenting changes

3. **Removed Code Duplication** (199 lines removed)
   - Removed duplicate/commented functions from main.rs:
     - `get_route_data_from_db()` (was commented)
     - `get_route_data_fallback()` (115 lines, unused)
     - `estimate_duration_from_route_id()` (was commented)
     - `estimate_duration_with_distance()` (was commented)
   - These functions properly exist in estimation.rs module

#### Evening Session - Mutation Testing & Maintenance
1. **Updated Mutation Testing Infrastructure**
   - Migrated from RAM disk to filesystem-based testing
   - Added timestamped output directories (mutation_results/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/)
   - Configured to use 8 threads, mold linker, and nextest
   - Added proper background execution with PID tracking
   - Successfully running with 1053 mutants

2. **Fixed Mt. Fuji Duration Estimation**
   - Issue: Mt. Fuji (route 2663908549) was estimating 39 minutes instead of 52-70
   - Root cause: estimate_duration_from_route_id was using route name instead of elevation data
   - Solution: Modified to use elevation-based multiplier when elevation data available
   - Result: All tests now passing, mutation testing can proceed

3. **Removed Duplicate Tests from main.rs**
   - Found 6 duplicate tests that existed in both main.rs and duration_estimation.rs
   - Removed: test_specific_route_multipliers, test_estimate_duration_for_category, 
     test_get_route_difficulty_multiplier_from_elevation, test_get_route_difficulty_multiplier
   - Created DUPLICATE_TESTS_REPORT.md documenting all 44 tests that need reorganization

4. **Updated PROJECT_WISDOM.md**
   - Added insight about continuous maintenance as foundation of software quality
   - Documented three pillars: comprehensive testing, code organization, disciplined refactoring
   - Included references to Rust-specific refactoring documents
   - Added critical note about LLM behavior requiring constraints to prevent wandering/rewriting

### Session Summary
- Deep research on Rust refactoring tools and best practices
- Successfully installed and used refactoring tools
- Created constants module to replace magic numbers throughout codebase
- Improved code organization by extracting display logic to separate module
- Enhanced test organization with tests in their appropriate modules
- Cleaned up 199 lines of duplicate/dead code + 130 lines of duplicate tests
- All tests passing after Mt. Fuji fix
- Mutation testing running successfully with improved infrastructure
- Comprehensive documentation created for refactoring and testing

### Active Processes
- Mutation testing running in background (check with ./check_mutation_progress.sh)
- Finding mutations that tests don't catch (9+ found so far)

### Next Actions
```bash
# Monitor mutation testing:
./check_mutation_progress.sh

# Continue test reorganization per DUPLICATE_TESTS_REPORT.md:
# - 13 tests to move to event_filtering.rs
# - 9 tests to move to event_display.rs
# - 5 tests to move to route_discovery.rs
# - 2 tests to move to database.rs

# Write tests to catch missed mutations:
# - Database functions returning early without doing work
# - Logical operators being flipped (&&/||, >/< etc)
# - Arithmetic operations being changed

# Extract more large functions from main.rs
```

### Refactoring Status
**Documentation Created**: 
- RUST_REFACTORING_RULES.md - Comprehensive refactoring guide
- RUST_REFACTORING_TOOLS.md - Tool installation and usage
- RUST_REFACTORING_BEST_PRACTICES.md - Rust idioms and conventions
- MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md - Future type-safe units migration
- TEST_ORGANIZATION.md - Test structure guide
- TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md - Changes made
- DUPLICATE_TESTS_REPORT.md - Test migration plan

**Code Improvements**:
- Removed unused urlencoding dependency
- Fixed unreadable number literals
- Replaced manual Default impls with derive
- Created constants.rs for common values
- Updated ~50 magic number occurrences
- Extracted event_display.rs module (329 lines)
- Removed 199 lines of duplicate/dead code
- Removed 130 lines of duplicate tests
- Fixed Mt. Fuji elevation-based duration calculation

**Modules Refactored**:
- event_display.rs - All event display functions extracted
- duration_estimation.rs - Tests added from main.rs, Mt. Fuji fix
- estimation.rs - Fixed to use elevation data when available
- Code duplication between main.rs and estimation.rs resolved

**Tools Installed**: cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete, cargo-mutants

### Key Commands
- `cargo test` - All tests passing ✅
- `./run_mutation_testing.sh` - Start mutation testing
- `./check_mutation_progress.sh` - Monitor mutation testing
- `cargo rm <dep>` - Remove unused dependencies
- `cargo expand` - View macro expansions
- `cargo machete` - Find unused dependencies
- See REFACTORING_RULES.md before any changes
- See TEST_ORGANIZATION.md for module-specific test commands

### Technical Debt Identified
1. 38 more tests in main.rs need to be moved to appropriate modules
2. main.rs is still large and could be further modularized
3. Mutation testing revealing gaps in test coverage
4. Consider shared test utilities module
5. Some database functions can return early without validation

### Commits Made Today
1. "refactor: integrate constants module and eliminate magic numbers"
2. "refactor: extract event display logic into separate module"
3. "test: improve test organization and add duration estimation tests"
4. "docs: add test reorganization summary"
5. "refactor: remove duplicate functions from main.rs"
6. "docs: update HANDOFF.md with session checkpoint"
