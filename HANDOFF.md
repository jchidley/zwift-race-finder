# Project: Zwift Race Finder
Updated: 2025-05-27 17:00 UTC

## Current State
Status: âœ… Requirements documentation complete and committed
Target: Ready to implement priority requirements from REQUIREMENTS.md
Latest: All project status files updated and committed

## Essential Context
- Requirements gathering addressed user's "not working as I'd like" concern
- Security HIGH priority: OAuth tokens stored in plain text files
- Tool verified working: 16.1% accuracy, 26/26 tests pass, finds races correctly
- 5 priority areas identified: security, config, physics, API limits, UX

## Next Step
Await user direction on which requirement to implement first

## If Blocked
Start with security (OAuth token storage) as it's marked HIGH priority
