# Handoff Document - Zwift Race Finder

## Current State (2025-01-06)

### Latest Session Update (Evening)
1. **Completed Test Refactoring**
   - Moved event display tests from main.rs to event_display.rs
   - Moved route discovery tests from main.rs to tests/integration_tests.rs (due to module import conflicts)
   - Successfully resolved all import issues and test compilation errors
   - All tests passing after refactoring

2. **Test Organization Progress**
   - Removed duplicate tests: test_duration_estimation_for_cat_d, test_edge_case_estimations
   - Moved 6 display tests to event_display.rs module
   - Moved 3 route discovery tests to integration_tests.rs
   - Fixed brace mismatch issues during test removal

### What Changed Today

#### Morning Session
- Installed Rust refactoring tools (cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete) ✅
- Created comprehensive Rust refactoring documentation ✅
- Extracted magic numbers into constants module (src/constants.rs) ✅
- Created migration plan for uom crate (MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md) ✅
- Fixed several code quality issues (unused deps, literals, Default impls) ✅

#### Afternoon Session - Code Organization
1. **Refactored Event Display Logic**
   - Extracted 329-line `print_event` function from main.rs into event_display.rs module
   - Broke down into smaller, focused functions:
     - `display_event_header()`, `display_route_info()`, `display_duration_info()`
     - `display_category_enforcement()`, `display_subgroups()`, `display_description_info()`
   - Fixed imports and compilation issues

2. **Test Organization**
   - Moved 6 duration estimation tests from main.rs to duration_estimation.rs
   - Fixed edge case test bug (0.1km with 1m elevation)
   - Created TEST_ORGANIZATION.md documenting test structure
   - Created TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md documenting changes

3. **Removed Code Duplication** (199 lines removed)
   - Removed duplicate/commented functions from main.rs:
     - `get_route_data_from_db()` (was commented)
     - `get_route_data_fallback()` (115 lines, unused)
     - `estimate_duration_from_route_id()` (was commented)
     - `estimate_duration_with_distance()` (was commented)
   - These functions properly exist in estimation.rs module

#### Evening Session - Test Migration Continuation
1. **Event Display Tests Migration**
   - Extracted EventTableRow struct and prepare_event_row to event_display.rs
   - Moved print_events_table function to event_display.rs
   - Moved display_filter_stats function and related tests to event_display.rs
   - Fixed import conflicts and duplicate function issues

2. **Route Discovery Tests Migration**
   - Attempted to move tests to route_discovery.rs but encountered module import conflicts
   - Successfully moved tests to tests/integration_tests.rs instead:
     - test_multi_lap_race_detection
     - test_get_multi_lap_distance
     - test_route_id_regression_with_actual_results
   - Fixed all import issues using zwift_race_finder:: library imports

3. **Removed Duplicate Tests from main.rs**
   - Removed test_duration_estimation_for_cat_d (duplicate of existing test)
   - Removed test_edge_case_estimations (duplicate functionality)
   - Fixed brace mismatch issues during removal
   - All tests continue to pass

### Session Summary
- Successfully continued test reorganization per DUPLICATE_TESTS_REPORT.md
- Moved 9 tests from main.rs to their appropriate modules/locations
- Resolved module import conflicts by using integration tests for complex dependencies
- Cleaned up duplicate tests and functions
- Fixed compilation and import issues throughout refactoring
- All tests passing after comprehensive test migration

### Active Processes
- Test reorganization progressing well
- Mutation testing ready to resume with better organized tests

### Next Actions
```bash
# Continue test reorganization per DUPLICATE_TESTS_REPORT.md:
# - Move database tests from main.rs to database.rs (2 remaining)
# - Write tests to catch missed mutations (178+ found by cargo-mutants)

# Check remaining tests in main.rs:
cargo test --bin zwift-race-finder --lib

# Start mutation testing to identify gaps:
./run_mutation_testing.sh
```

### Test Migration Status
**Completed**:
- ✅ Event display tests → event_display.rs (6 tests moved)
- ✅ Route discovery tests → tests/integration_tests.rs (3 tests moved)
- ✅ Duplicate tests removed from main.rs (2 tests removed)

**Remaining**:
- ⏳ Database tests → database.rs (2 tests)
- ⏳ Write tests for missed mutations (178+ identified)

### Refactoring Status
**Documentation Created**: 
- RUST_REFACTORING_RULES.md - Comprehensive refactoring guide
- RUST_REFACTORING_TOOLS.md - Tool installation and usage
- RUST_REFACTORING_BEST_PRACTICES.md - Rust idioms and conventions
- MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md - Future type-safe units migration
- TEST_ORGANIZATION.md - Test structure guide
- TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md - Changes made
- DUPLICATE_TESTS_REPORT.md - Test migration plan

**Code Improvements**:
- Removed unused urlencoding dependency
- Fixed unreadable number literals
- Replaced manual Default impls with derive
- Created constants.rs for common values
- Updated ~50 magic number occurrences
- Extracted event_display.rs module (329 lines)
- Removed 199 lines of duplicate/dead code
- Removed duplicate tests and moved tests to appropriate modules
- Fixed Mt. Fuji elevation-based duration calculation

**Modules Refactored**:
- event_display.rs - All event display functions and tests extracted
- tests/integration_tests.rs - Route discovery tests added due to import conflicts
- duration_estimation.rs - Tests added from main.rs, Mt. Fuji fix
- estimation.rs - Fixed to use elevation data when available
- Code duplication between main.rs and other modules resolved

**Tools Installed**: cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete, cargo-mutants

### Key Commands
- `cargo test` - All tests passing ✅
- `./run_mutation_testing.sh` - Start mutation testing
- `./check_mutation_progress.sh` - Monitor mutation testing
- `cargo rm <dep>` - Remove unused dependencies
- `cargo expand` - View macro expansions
- `cargo machete` - Find unused dependencies
- See REFACTORING_RULES.md before any changes
- See TEST_ORGANIZATION.md for module-specific test commands

### Technical Debt Identified
1. Database tests still in main.rs need to be moved to database.rs
2. Mutation testing revealing gaps in test coverage (178+ missed mutations)
3. main.rs still large but significantly improved
4. Consider shared test utilities module for common test functions

### Commits Made Today
1. "refactor: integrate constants module and eliminate magic numbers"
2. "refactor: extract event display logic into separate module"
3. "test: improve test organization and add duration estimation tests"
4. "docs: add test reorganization summary"
5. "refactor: remove duplicate functions from main.rs"
6. "docs: update HANDOFF.md with session checkpoint"
7. "fix: use elevation-based difficulty for Mt. Fuji duration estimation"
8. "refactor: move event display tests and functions to event_display module"
9. "refactor: move route discovery tests to integration tests"
