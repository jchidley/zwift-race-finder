# HANDOFF.md - Zwift Race Finder

## Project Status - 2025-01-08

### Current Branch: feature/uom-migration-v2

The UOM (Units of Measurement) migration framework is now complete. After the initial migration attempt failed (finding 0 races instead of 10), we built a comprehensive behavioral preservation framework inspired by the uutils project.

### Recent Work Completed

1. **Test Framework Optimization**
   - Reduced golden tests from 9,414 to 1,694 (82% reduction)
   - Validated test data is statistically representative (<3% difference)
   - Created test data validation tools

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Full progress report since commit 0169788
   - Technical summary and architecture
   - Visual timeline of work
   - Quick start guide for migration

3. **Key Infrastructure Ready**
   - Golden behavioral tests (1,694)
   - Property-based invariant tests
   - A/B testing framework
   - Compatibility tracking system

### Current State

**Framework: ✅ Complete**  
**Migration: ❌ Not Started**

No UOM code has been written yet. The entire effort has been building the framework to ensure safe migration.

### Next Immediate Steps

1. **Run Mutation Testing**
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-mutants
   cargo mutants
   ```

2. **Start First Migration**
   - Begin with `calculate_pack_speed()` in `duration_estimation.rs`
   - Use A/B testing to verify identical behavior
   - Check all golden tests still pass

3. **Read Documentation**
   - Quick start: `docs/development/20250108_143800_uom_migration_quick_start.md`
   - Full details: `docs/development/20250108_143500_uom_migration_v2_progress.md`

### Key Principle

> "Any difference with current behavior is a bug"

The golden tests define the specification. All must pass after migration.

### Recent Commits

- `01aad09` - docs: add comprehensive UOM migration V2 documentation
- `162a261` - fix: add public database methods for test data validation
- `268bd21` - feat: add test data validation against production database
- `09da41c` - refactor: improve golden test strategy and reduce test count by 82%

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run golden tests specifically  
cargo test golden

# Validate test data quality
./tools/utils/validate_test_data.sh

# Run property tests
cargo test property

# Generate new golden baseline (if needed)
cargo test generate_golden_baseline_improved -- --ignored
```

- Statistical accuracy: <3% difference from production
- Framework components: 5 major systems
- Documentation: 10+ comprehensive guides

## Previous Session Summary (2025-01-06)

Successfully fixed regression tests, cleaned database, and created comprehensive mutation testing documentation.

### What Was Done Previously

1. **Fixed Regression Tests** - Optimized queries, tests complete in ~1.2 seconds
2. **Cleaned Database** - Removed 7,460 duplicate test entries
3. **Organized Documentation** - Moved files to appropriate subdirectories
4. **Created Mutation Testing Guide** - Comprehensive guide with industry research

### Commands for Testing

```bash
# Run optimized regression tests
cargo test test_race_predictions_accuracy --lib

# Run full regression suite (slower)
cargo test test_all_race_predictions_accuracy --lib -- --ignored

# Check mutation testing on specific module
cargo mutants --file src/duration_estimation.rs

# View organized documentation
ls docs/development/
```
