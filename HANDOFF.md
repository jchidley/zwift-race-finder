# Handoff Document - Zwift Race Finder

## Current State (2025-01-06)

### What Changed
- Installed Rust refactoring tools (cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete) ✅
- Created comprehensive Rust refactoring documentation ✅
- Extracted magic numbers into constants module (src/constants.rs) ✅
- Created migration plan for uom crate (MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md) ✅
- Fixed several code quality issues (unused deps, literals, Default impls) ✅

### Session Summary
- Deep research on Rust refactoring tools and best practices
- Successfully installed and used refactoring tools
- Created constants module to replace magic numbers throughout codebase
- Planned future migration to type-safe uom crate for unit handling
- Mutation testing shows 27% coverage - significant improvement needed

### Active Processes
- Mutation testing may still be running (disk space issues noted)
- Use `ps aux | grep cargo-mutants` to verify

### Next Actions
```bash
# Run full test suite:
cargo test

# Check mutation test results:
cat mutants.out/missed.txt | wc -l  # Count of uncaught mutants

# Priority refactoring targets:
# 1. Extract large functions from main.rs (>500 lines)
# 2. Improve test coverage for mutation testing
# 3. Consolidate error handling patterns
```

### Refactoring Status
**Documentation Created**: 
- RUST_REFACTORING_RULES.md - Comprehensive refactoring guide
- RUST_REFACTORING_TOOLS.md - Tool installation and usage
- MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md - Future type-safe units migration

**Code Improvements**:
- Removed unused urlencoding dependency
- Fixed unreadable number literals
- Replaced manual Default impls with derive
- Created constants.rs for common values
- Updated ~50 magic number occurrences

**Tools Installed**: cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete

### Key Commands
- `cargo test` - All tests passing
- `cargo rm <dep>` - Remove unused dependencies
- `cargo expand` - View macro expansions
- `cargo machete` - Find unused dependencies
- See REFACTORING_RULES.md before any changes
