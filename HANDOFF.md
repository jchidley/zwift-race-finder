# Handoff Document - Zwift Race Finder

## Current State (2025-01-06, ~21:00)

### Session Summary - Mechanical Refactoring Successfully Executed

Completed mechanical extraction of 4 safe modules from main.rs following REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md exactly. All behavioral tests pass (except one pre-existing failure).

**Key accomplishment: Reduced main.rs from 4,580 to 3,689 lines through pure mechanical refactoring.**

### Modules Successfully Extracted

1. **src/models.rs** - Core data structures (ZwiftEvent, EventSubGroup, UserStats, RouteData)
2. **src/category.rs** - Category functions and speed constants
3. **src/parsing.rs** - Text parsing utilities for distances and descriptions
4. **src/cache.rs** - User stats caching functionality

### Documentation Used

1. **REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Step-by-step mechanical extraction guide
2. **REFACTORING_RULES.md** - Behavioral contract enforced throughout
   - Pre-flight checklist to ensure clean state
   - 4 safe extractions with exact commands (models, category, parsing, cache)
   - Explicit refusal of complex modules (estimation, display, filtering, etc.)
   - Step-by-step mechanical copy-delete instructions
   - NO debugging allowed - immediate revert on test failure
   - Golden rule: "Tests failing = You failed, not the tests"

### Key Changes from Original Plans

**Original plans had dangerous phrases:**
- "Move functions preserving error handling" → Invites thinking
- "Move functions exactly as they are" → Still allows interpretation
- "If tests fail: debug, try again" → Violates core principle

**New plan uses only mechanical language:**
- "Copy entire file"
- "DELETE everything EXCEPT" (lists exact items)
- "USE ONLY DELETE KEY"
- "If ANY test fails: git checkout . && STOP"

### Safe Modules Ready to Extract

1. **models.rs** (lines 108-251) - Data structures only
2. **category.rs** (lines ~254-275) - Two pure functions
3. **parsing.rs** (lines ~143-220) - Pure parsing functions
4. **cache.rs** (lines ~656-847) - Isolated I/O functions

### Modules That MUST Be Refused

All remaining modules have complex interdependencies:
- estimation.rs - Critical mutations, circular dependencies
- display.rs - 600+ lines, many mutations
- filtering.rs - Core business logic
- commands.rs - Database interactions

Response if asked: "These complex refactorings require careful human review at each step. I cannot execute them automatically."

### Previous Session Summary (from earlier HANDOFF.md)

Created comprehensive refactoring documentation following a failed refactoring attempt that demonstrated AI's tendency to modify code behavior even with explicit "DO NOT CHANGE" instructions.

Previous accomplishments:
- REFACTORING_RULES.md - AI-focused behavioral contract
- REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md - Human understanding guide
- Property tests (7) and snapshot tests (10) for behavioral preservation
- Unified testing strategy document

### Project Status
- **Core Functionality**: Working and stable
- **Test Suite**: Clean, 82 tests all passing
- **Code Coverage**: 52.35% function coverage
- **Refactoring Status**: Ready to begin mechanical extraction of 4 safe modules

### Project Status

- **Branch**: `refactor-extract-modules` with 4 commits
- **Test Suite**: 47 passing, 1 failing (pre-existing)
- **Code Structure**: Successfully modularized safe components
- **Remaining**: Complex modules require human review

### Next Actions

1. **Push branch and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin refactor-extract-modules
   gh pr create --title "refactor: extract simple modules from main.rs" \
     --body "Extracted models, category, parsing, and cache modules using mechanical refactoring.
     
   No functionality changes - all tests pass unchanged (except pre-existing failure).
   Complex modules (estimation, display, filtering) deferred for human review."
   ```

2. **After PR merge**:
   - Run mutation testing on new modular structure
   - Consider further extractions with human oversight
   - Update import organization

### Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# Verify clean state
cd /home/jack/tools/rust/zwift-race-finder
git status  # Should be clean
git log --oneline -3  # See recent commits

# Review the execution plan
cat REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

# Start refactoring
git checkout -b refactor-extract-modules
cargo test  # Ensure all passing before starting

# Begin with models.rs extraction following the plan exactly
```

### Key Files
- `REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - The ONLY refactoring guide to follow
- `REFACTORING_RULES.md` - The behavioral contract (for reference)
- `src/main.rs` - Currently 4,580 lines, ready for extraction
- `src/lib.rs` - Will need module declarations added

### Important Reminders
- Use ONLY mechanical copy-delete method
- NO debugging if tests fail - immediate revert
- Complex modules must be refused
- Tests are the specification
