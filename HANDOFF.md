# Project: Zwift Race Finder
Updated: 2025-05-26 16:10 UTC

## Current State
Status: UX improvements complete - tool now guides users effectively
Target: Production ready with helpful output
Latest: Added event type counts & context-aware "no results" suggestions

## Essential Context
- Now shows: "Found: 91 group rides, 52 races, 33 group workouts, 5 time trials"
- Smart suggestions when no results (e.g., "Most races are short (20-30 minutes)")
- Provides working command examples: `cargo run -- -d 30 -t 30`
- Tested all scenarios - short races, TT, group rides work perfectly

## Next Step
Consider default parameters adjustment (maybe -d 60 -t 60 instead of -d 120)

## If Blocked
N/A - implementation complete
