# Project: Zwift Race Finder
Updated: 2025-06-02 UTC

## Current State
Status: Production ready - all warnings fixed, tests passing
Target: Ready for deployment and continued feature development
Latest: Fixed all compiler warnings and improved code documentation

## Essential Context
- All 264 routes populated with accurate lead-in distance data
- Regression tests passing with 16.1% accuracy (exceeded <20% target)
- Code builds cleanly with no warnings
- Documentation added for all public APIs
- Test data cleaned up (removed "Test Race" entries)

## Completed Today
1. ✅ Fixed all compiler warnings
   - Removed unused functions (get_route_data_enhanced, discover_route_if_needed)
   - Fixed unnecessary parentheses
   - Added missing documentation for all public items
   - Marked intentionally unused fields with #[allow(dead_code)]
2. ✅ Fixed failing regression test
   - Filtered out "Test Race" entries in route mapping consistency test
   - Cleaned up test data from database
3. ✅ Improved code quality
   - Added rustdoc comments for all modules, structs, and methods
   - Used proper visibility modifiers (#[cfg(test)] for test-only code)
   - Ensured all tests pass after changes

## Next Step
Project is ready for deployment. Consider:
- Publishing to crates.io
- Creating GitHub release
- Implementing additional features from REQUIREMENTS.md
- Adding more route data sources for improved accuracy

## If Blocked
Run `cargo test` to verify all tests pass
Run `cargo build --all-targets` to check for warnings
