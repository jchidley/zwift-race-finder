## Current State (2025-06-04, 12:30)

### Recent Work - Completed Phase 4 Coverage Evaluation
Successfully completed Phase 4 of the coverage plan with important discoveries:

1. **Coverage Progress Update**:
   - Started: 41.77% function coverage (92/158 uncovered in main.rs)
   - Current: 52.35% function coverage (81/170 uncovered in main.rs)
   - Improvement: +10.58% coverage with 12 new functions tested
   - Test quality: 100% natural tests (12/12)

2. **Phases Completed**:
   - ✅ Phase 1: Pure utility functions (4 tested)
   - ✅ Phase 2: Data preparation functions (4 tested)
   - ✅ Phase 3: I/O functions (3 tested)
   - ✅ Phase 4: Evaluation completed (1 test added, comprehensive report created)

3. **Key Discoveries**:
   - Coverage Anomaly: Many tested functions show as uncovered
   - All 12 functions tested with natural tests (100% quality)
   - Majority of remaining functions need integration tests, not unit tests
   - Current approach validates excellent code structure

4. **Documentation Created**:
   - PHASE4_EVALUATION_REPORT_20250604_122500.md - Comprehensive analysis
   - SESSION_20250604_PHASE4_COMPLETION.md - Session summary
   - SESSION_20250604_PHASE4A_PROGRESS.md - Detailed progress tracking
   - Updated PROJECT_WISDOM.md with meta-insights
   - Strategic testing recommendations documented

### Project Status
- **Core Functionality**: Working and stable
- **Test Suite**: Clean, 82 tests all passing (added 12 new tests)
- **Code Organization**: Well-structured, proven by 100% natural test rate
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with strategic testing plan

### Active Features
1. **Race Finding**: Duration-based filtering with ±tolerance
2. **Racing Score Support**: Handles both traditional and Racing Score events
3. **Route Discovery**: Can fetch route data from web sources
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track completed routes
5. **Multiple Output Formats**: Table (default) and verbose modes

### Known Issues
- Config tests change current directory (could affect parallel testing)
- Some duration estimates may need calibration updates
- Route mappings need periodic updates as new routes are added

### Next Opportunities
1. **Investigate Coverage Anomalies** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - Many functions with tests show as uncovered
   - Check test execution paths and branch coverage
   - Consider alternative coverage tools if needed
   - This could reveal we already have higher coverage than reported
2. **Create Integration Test Suite**:
   - Database functions with test fixtures
   - API functions with recorded responses
   - CLI commands end-to-end testing
   - Based on PHASE4_EVALUATION_REPORT recommendations
3. **Set Realistic Coverage Targets**:
   - Unit tests: 60% (focus on pure functions)
   - Integration tests: 80% (I/O and network)
   - Total coverage: 85%+ (combined approach)
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: After coverage investigation

### Development Patterns
- Use session logs (SESSION_*.md) to track work
- Test changes thoroughly - good test suite now
- Keep PROJECT_WISDOM.md updated with learnings
- Run `cargo test` before committing changes

### Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# Check current state
git status
cargo test

# See recent changes
git log --oneline -10

# Run coverage analysis (excluding dev binaries)
cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --ignore-filename-regex "src/bin/.*"

# Run the tool
cargo run -- --duration 30 --tolerance 15

# Test writing approach for 100% coverage:
# 1. Follow FUNCTION_COVERAGE_PLAN_20250604_084639.md
# 2. Start with Phase 1 pure functions
# 3. Track test quality: natural ✅ vs contrived ⚠️/❌
# 4. Document in SESSION_20250604_COVERAGE_BASELINE.md
