## Current State
Status: Route discovery pivoting to event description parsing
Target: Extract route names from event descriptions (e.g., "3 laps of Volcano Circuit")
Latest: Identified that event descriptions likely contain actual route names with lap counts

## Essential Context
- Direct site APIs work but event names â‰  route names
- Key Insight: Event descriptions often mention actual routes
- Example patterns: "3 laps of [Route]", "[Route] x 2", "Stage 4: [Route]"
- This could solve 189 unknown routes without manual mapping
- Already have description field in API responses

## Next Step
Parse event descriptions with regex to extract route names and lap counts

## If Blocked
Fall back to manual mapping table for high-frequency events
