# Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Current State
Status: ✅ Production ready - 23.6% accuracy (exceeded <30% target)
Target: Clean working directory with all changes committed
Latest: Fixed Strava import, achieved 80% race matching, all tests pass

## Essential Context
- strava_import_to_db.sh fixed with temp table approach (SQLite workaround)
- 131/163 races matched to Strava (80% is excellent)
- Unmatched races simply don't exist in Strava (normal)
- Mean error down from 92.8% → 23.6% through iterative improvements
- strava_config.json still has tokens (don't commit)

## Next Step
Commit strava_import_to_db.sh changes (exclude strava_config.json)

## If Blocked
Use git add -p to selectively stage changes
