# Handoff Document - Zwift Race Finder

## Current State (2025-01-06)

### What Changed Today

#### Morning Session
- Installed Rust refactoring tools (cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete) ✅
- Created comprehensive Rust refactoring documentation ✅
- Extracted magic numbers into constants module (src/constants.rs) ✅
- Created migration plan for uom crate (MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md) ✅
- Fixed several code quality issues (unused deps, literals, Default impls) ✅

#### Afternoon Session - Code Organization
1. **Refactored Event Display Logic**
   - Extracted 329-line `print_event` function from main.rs into event_display.rs module
   - Broke down into smaller, focused functions:
     - `display_event_header()`, `display_route_info()`, `display_duration_info()`
     - `display_category_enforcement()`, `display_subgroups()`, `display_description_info()`
   - Fixed imports and compilation issues

2. **Test Organization**
   - Moved 6 duration estimation tests from main.rs to duration_estimation.rs
   - Fixed edge case test bug (0.1km with 1m elevation)
   - Created TEST_ORGANIZATION.md documenting test structure
   - Created TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md documenting changes

3. **Removed Code Duplication** (199 lines removed)
   - Removed duplicate/commented functions from main.rs:
     - `get_route_data_from_db()` (was commented)
     - `get_route_data_fallback()` (115 lines, unused)
     - `estimate_duration_from_route_id()` (was commented)
     - `estimate_duration_with_distance()` (was commented)
   - These functions properly exist in estimation.rs module

### Session Summary
- Deep research on Rust refactoring tools and best practices
- Successfully installed and used refactoring tools
- Created constants module to replace magic numbers throughout codebase
- Improved code organization by extracting display logic to separate module
- Enhanced test organization with tests in their appropriate modules
- Cleaned up 199 lines of duplicate/dead code
- All tests passing (except pre-existing Mt. Fuji test)
- Mutation testing shows 27% coverage - needs improvement

### Active Processes
- None currently running

### Next Actions
```bash
# Run full test suite:
cargo test

# Check specific module tests:
cargo test --lib duration_estimation::tests
cargo test --lib event_filtering::tests

# Check mutation test results (if completed):
cat mutants.out/missed.txt | wc -l  # Count of uncaught mutants

# Priority tasks:
# 1. Fix Mt. Fuji duration estimation test
# 2. Remove duplicate tests from main.rs (already in modules)
# 3. Extract more large functions from main.rs
# 4. Improve test coverage for mutation testing
```

### Refactoring Status
**Documentation Created**: 
- RUST_REFACTORING_RULES.md - Comprehensive refactoring guide
- RUST_REFACTORING_TOOLS.md - Tool installation and usage
- MIGRATION_TO_UOM_PLAN.md - Future type-safe units migration
- TEST_ORGANIZATION.md - Test structure guide
- TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md - Changes made

**Code Improvements**:
- Removed unused urlencoding dependency
- Fixed unreadable number literals
- Replaced manual Default impls with derive
- Created constants.rs for common values
- Updated ~50 magic number occurrences
- Extracted event_display.rs module (329 lines)
- Removed 199 lines of duplicate/dead code

**Modules Refactored**:
- event_display.rs - All event display functions extracted
- duration_estimation.rs - Tests added from main.rs
- Code duplication between main.rs and estimation.rs resolved

**Tools Installed**: cargo-edit, cargo-expand, cargo-machete

### Key Commands
- `cargo test` - All tests passing (except Mt. Fuji)
- `cargo rm <dep>` - Remove unused dependencies
- `cargo expand` - View macro expansions
- `cargo machete` - Find unused dependencies
- See REFACTORING_RULES.md before any changes
- See TEST_ORGANIZATION.md for module-specific test commands

### Technical Debt Identified
1. Duplicate tests still exist in main.rs (should be removed)
2. main.rs is still large and could be further modularized
3. Mt. Fuji duration estimation needs investigation
4. Consider shared test utilities module
5. Mutation test coverage at 27% - needs improvement

### Commits Made Today
1. "refactor: integrate constants module and eliminate magic numbers"
2. "refactor: extract event display logic into separate module"
3. "test: improve test organization and add duration estimation tests"
4. "docs: add test reorganization summary"
5. "refactor: remove duplicate functions from main.rs"

### Files Modified
- src/constants.rs (created)
- src/event_display.rs (created)
- src/duration_estimation.rs (tests added)
- src/lib.rs (modules added)
- src/main.rs (functions extracted, duplicates removed)
- Multiple documentation files created
