# Handoff Document - Zwift Race Finder

## Current State (2025-01-06, ~12:00)

### Session Summary - Refactoring Documentation Complete

Created comprehensive refactoring documentation following a failed refactoring attempt that demonstrated AI's tendency to modify code behavior even with explicit "DO NOT CHANGE" instructions.

Key accomplishment: **Two-document system that uses prompt engineering to constrain AI behavior during refactoring through mechanical processes.**

Key insight: **"Remove the opportunity to think, and you remove the opportunity to 'improve'"**

### Documentation Created

1. **REFACTORING_RULES.md** (6KB) - AI-focused behavioral contract
   - Critical contract with XML tags for psychological commitment
   - Catalog of safe refactoring mechanics for 6 types
   - STOP signals to interrupt dangerous thoughts
   - Concrete failure examples from actual session
   - Decision tree for complexity assessment
   - Recovery protocol: revert, don't debug

2. **REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md** (8.5KB) - Human understanding guide
   - Full overview of Fowler's 60+ refactoring types
   - Why AI fails: improvement bias from training
   - Real examples of functionality loss
   - Difficulty ratings and AI vs human guidance
   - **How to activate the rules** (5 methods)

### The Core Problem and Solution

**Problem**: AI assistants activate multiple "helpful" behaviors during refactoring:
- Code review mode ("How can I improve this?")
- Problem-solving mode ("What can I fix?")
- Modernization mode ("Use current best practices")
- Efficiency mode ("This could be optimized")

**Solution**: Mechanical processes that prevent thinking:
- Move Function: Copy entire file, delete unwanted parts
- Extract Function: Copy exact fragment, no rewrites
- Rename: Change names ONLY, nothing else
- Complex refactorings: Often better refused

### Previous Session - Failed Refactoring Attempt

Attempted to refactor parsing functions from main.rs to parsing.rs module. Despite explicit "DO NOT CHANGE" instructions, I modified code behavior, breaking tests and functionality. Reverted all changes.

Full details in: `sessions/SESSION_20250106_REFACTORING_FAILURE.md`

### Recent Work - Behavioral Preservation Implementation

1. **Testing Dependencies Installed**:
   - Added proptest (0.11.0) for property-based testing
   - Added insta (1.41.0) for snapshot testing
   - Added rstest (0.24.0) for parameterized tests
   - Added criterion (0.5) for performance benchmarking
   - All dependencies installed successfully with cargo

2. **Property Tests Created** (`tests/property_tests.rs`):
   - **7 property tests** covering duration estimation invariants:
     - Basic invariants: positive durations, minimum bounds, reasonable maximums
     - Monotonicity: longer/harder routes take more time
     - Category ordering: A < B < C < D riders for same route
   - All tests passing, validating core behavioral assumptions

3. **Snapshot Tests Created** (`tests/snapshot_tests.rs`):
   - **10 snapshot tests** for known routes with precise calculations
   - Tests all 4 categories (A, B, C, D) for each route
   - Captures complete duration calculation details for regression detection
   - Initial snapshots reviewed and committed

4. **Project Wisdom Enhanced**:
   - Added insight about documentation enabling parallel AI work
   - Recognized that comprehensive docs prevent conflicting changes
   - Updated PROJECT_WISDOM.md with new section

### Previous Work - Behavioral Preservation Research & Unified Testing Strategy

Major accomplishment: Created unified testing and behavioral preservation strategy that eliminates overlap and provides single coherent approach.

1. **Behavioral Preservation Research Completed**:
   - Comprehensive research document on preventing unintended code changes
   - Identified key tools: snapshot testing (insta), property testing (proptest), mutation testing (cargo-mutants)
   - Documented industry best practices from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon
   - Location: `docs/research/BEHAVIORAL_PRESERVATION_RESEARCH.md`

2. **Unified Testing Strategy Created**:
   - Combined Modern Testing Strategy with Behavioral Preservation into single approach
   - Created 3-pillar framework: Foundation → Preservation → Feedback
   - Eliminated overlap between two previous documents
   - Location: `docs/development/UNIFIED_TESTING_AND_PRESERVATION_STRATEGY_20250106_220000.md`

3. **Key Insight Refined**:
   - Evolution: "Code coverage reveals dead code" → "Test quality reveals code quality" → "Behavioral tests provide both confidence and protection"
   - The same tests that give confidence to ship also protect against regressions
   - One cohesive strategy instead of two overlapping approaches

4. **Updated Todo List (Prioritized for Impact)**:
   - **High Priority**: Install deps, add property tests, create snapshots, run mutation testing, document behaviors
   - **Medium Priority**: Validation scripts, performance benchmarks
   - **Low Priority**: Coverage investigation, production telemetry

### Previous Work - Modern Testing Strategy & Coverage Analysis
Following research validation, created actionable testing strategy and concrete todos:

1. **Testing Philosophy Documented**:
   - Created WHY_NOT_100_PERCENT_COVERAGE.md explaining coverage paradox
   - Established that 100% coverage with mocks < 70% coverage with natural tests
   - Documented test pyramid: Unit (60%) → Integration (80%) → E2E (95%)

2. **Academic Research Validation**:
   - Comprehensive report: SOFTWARE_TESTING_STATE_OF_ART_2025.md
   - Line coverage correlation with bugs: only 0.3-0.5 (weak)
   - Industry leaders (Google, Netflix, Amazon) ship at 60-70% coverage
   - Our 52% coverage with 100% natural tests = industry best practice

3. **Coverage Progress**:
   - Started: 41.77% function coverage (92/158 uncovered in main.rs)
   - Current: 52.35% function coverage (81/170 uncovered in main.rs)
   - Improvement: +10.58% coverage with 12 new functions tested
   - Test quality: 100% natural tests (12/12)

### Project Status
- **Core Functionality**: Working and stable
- **Test Suite**: Clean, 82 tests all passing
- **Code Organization**: Well-structured, proven by 100% natural test rate
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with unified testing strategy

### Active Features
1. **Race Finding**: Duration-based filtering with ±tolerance
2. **Racing Score Support**: Handles both traditional and Racing Score events
3. **Route Discovery**: Can fetch route data from web sources
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track completed routes
5. **Multiple Output Formats**: Table (default) and verbose modes
6. **Property Testing**: 7 tests validating duration estimation invariants
7. **Snapshot Testing**: 10 routes with full calculation details captured

### Known Issues
- Config tests change current directory (could affect parallel testing)
- Some duration estimates may need calibration updates
- Route mappings need periodic updates as new routes are added

### Next Actions (Updated Todo List - High Impact First)

**High Priority (Quick Wins - 30-60 minutes each)**:
1. ✅ Install testing dependencies: proptest, insta, rstest, criterion
2. ✅ Add property tests for duration estimation invariants (monotonicity, bounds)
3. ✅ Create snapshot tests for 10 known race calculations
4. Run mutation testing with cargo-mutants to find weak tests
5. Create behaviors.yaml documenting core behavioral invariants

**Medium Priority (1-2 hours each)**:
6. Set up pre-change and post-change validation scripts
7. Add performance benchmarks with criterion for duration estimation

**Low Priority (Later/Complex)**:
8. Investigate coverage anomalies - why tested functions show as uncovered
9. Implement production telemetry for estimate accuracy tracking

### Development Patterns
- Use session logs (SESSION_*.md) to track work
- Follow unified testing strategy for behavioral preservation
- Keep PROJECT_WISDOM.md updated with learnings
- Run pre-change checklist before modifications

### Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# Check current state
cd /home/jack/tools/rust/zwift-race-finder
git status
cargo test

# Run mutation testing (next high-priority todo)
cargo install cargo-mutants
cargo mutants

# Review test files created
ls tests/property_tests.rs tests/snapshot_tests.rs
ls tests/snapshots/

# Run coverage analysis (excluding dev binaries)
cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --ignore-filename-regex "src/bin/.*"

# Run the tool
cargo run -- --duration 30 --tolerance 15
```
