Updated: 2025-05-27 16:45 UTC

## Current State
Status: âœ… Requirements gathering complete - REQUIREMENTS.md created from 41 file review
Target: Ready for next phase of development based on comprehensive requirements
Latest: Committed REQUIREMENTS.md and supporting documentation

## Essential Context
- User stated: "This need 'I'm not convinced that the program is working as I'd like' is being addressed by building the REQUIREMENTS.md document from all of the project files"
- Requirements doc now captures all functional and non-functional requirements
- Key findings documented: security concerns, configuration needs, physics potential, API limitations
- Tool functionality verified: runs correctly, all tests passing (26/26), 16.1% accuracy maintained

## Next Step
Await user direction on which requirement to implement first (security, config, physics, etc.)

## If Blocked
Review REQUIREMENTS.md priorities section for guidance on what to work on next
