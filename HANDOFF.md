## Current State (2025-06-04, 10:00)

### Recent Work - Executing 100% Function Coverage Plan
Successfully executing the systematic coverage plan with excellent results:

1. **Coverage Progress Update**:
   - Started: 41.77% function coverage (92/158 uncovered in main.rs)
   - Current: 52.07% function coverage (81/169 uncovered in main.rs)
   - Improvement: +10.3% coverage with 11 new functions tested
   - Test quality: 100% natural tests (11/11)

2. **Phases Completed**:
   - ‚úÖ Phase 1: Pure utility functions (4 tested)
   - ‚úÖ Phase 2: Data preparation functions (4 tested)
   - ‚úÖ Phase 3: I/O functions (3 tested)
   - üîÑ Phase 4: Network/CLI handlers (pending evaluation)

3. **Key Achievements**:
   - All 11 functions tested with natural tests
   - Zero contrived tests needed - validates code quality
   - I/O functions properly isolated with temp directories
   - Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

4. **Documentation Updated**:
   - SESSION_20250604_PHASE1_COVERAGE.md - Detailed progress tracking
   - SESSION_20250604_100_COVERAGE_EXECUTION.md - Session wrap-up
   - PROJECT_WISDOM.md - Added 4 meta-insights about AI development
   - Shows test quality for each function
   - Documents profound insights about building tools to build tools

### Project Status
- **Core Functionality**: Working and stable
- **Test Suite**: Clean, 81 tests all passing (added 11 new tests)
- **Code Organization**: Well-structured, proven by natural test ease
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with progress tracking

### Active Features
1. **Race Finding**: Duration-based filtering with ¬±tolerance
2. **Racing Score Support**: Handles both traditional and Racing Score events
3. **Route Discovery**: Can fetch route data from web sources
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track completed routes
5. **Multiple Output Formats**: Table (default) and verbose modes

### Known Issues
- Config tests change current directory (could affect parallel testing)
- Some duration estimates may need calibration updates
- Route mappings need periodic updates as new routes are added

### Next Opportunities
1. **Continue Coverage Plan - Phase 4**:
   - Evaluate network functions (fetch_events, fetch_zwiftpower_stats)
   - Test business logic (filter_events, estimate_duration_with_distance)
   - Assess CLI handlers for unit vs integration testing
   - Current: 81 functions remaining in main.rs
2. **Investigate Coverage Anomalies**:
   - Some functions show uncovered despite having tests
   - May need to check test execution paths
   - Consider if coverage tool has configuration issues
3. **Target 80%+ Coverage**:
   - Currently at 52.07%, need ~28% more
   - Focus on high-value business logic functions
   - Skip CLI handlers if integration tests are better
4. **Performance**: Use benchmarks after achieving coverage target

### Development Patterns
- Use session logs (SESSION_*.md) to track work
- Test changes thoroughly - good test suite now
- Keep PROJECT_WISDOM.md updated with learnings
- Run `cargo test` before committing changes

### Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# Check current state
git status
cargo test

# See recent changes
git log --oneline -10

# Run coverage analysis (excluding dev binaries)
cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --ignore-filename-regex "src/bin/.*"

# Run the tool
cargo run -- --duration 30 --tolerance 15

# Test writing approach for 100% coverage:
# 1. Follow FUNCTION_COVERAGE_PLAN_20250604_084639.md
# 2. Start with Phase 1 pure functions
# 3. Track test quality: natural ‚úÖ vs contrived ‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå
# 4. Document in SESSION_20250604_COVERAGE_BASELINE.md
