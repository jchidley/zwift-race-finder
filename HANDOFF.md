# Project: Zwift Race Finder
Updated: 2025-06-03 UTC

## Current State
Status: Production ready - documentation reorganized
Target: Ready for deployment and continued feature development
Latest: Reorganized documentation into docs/ directory for better maintainability

## Essential Context
- All 264 routes populated with accurate lead-in distance data
- Regression tests passing with 16.1% accuracy (exceeded <20% target)
- Code builds cleanly with no warnings
- Documentation added for all public APIs
- Test data cleaned up (removed "Test Race" entries)

## Completed Today
1. ✅ Reorganized documentation structure
   - Moved 26 documentation files from root to organized subdirectories
   - Created docs/development/, docs/research/, docs/guides/, docs/archive/
   - Kept only essential files in root: README, REQUIREMENTS, CLAUDE, HANDOFF, todo
   - Updated all references to moved files
   - Added docs/README.md to explain documentation structure
2. ✅ Preserved project history
   - Kept ACCURACY_TIMELINE.md showing unique development progression
   - Maintained all research, guides, and historical handoffs
   - Clean git history with proper file moves (not deletes/creates)

## Next Step
Project is ready for deployment. Consider:
- Publishing to crates.io
- Creating GitHub release
- Implementing additional features from REQUIREMENTS.md
- Adding more route data sources for improved accuracy

## If Blocked
Run `cargo test` to verify all tests pass
Run `cargo build --all-targets` to check for warnings
