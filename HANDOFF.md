# Handoff Document - Zwift Race Finder

## Current State (2025-01-06, ~22:30)

### Latest Session - Post-Refactoring Cleanup and Analysis

Fixed test failure and started mutation testing on refactored modules.

**Key accomplishments:**
- Fixed `test_racing_score_event_filtering` (wrong route_id: 9 → 3379779247)
- Cleaned up all compilation warnings
- Created mutation testing scripts for background execution
- Analyzed remaining refactoring opportunities with risk assessment
- All 89 tests now passing

### Previous Session Summary - Mechanical Refactoring Complete and Merged

Successfully executed mechanical extraction of 4 safe modules from main.rs and merged to main branch.

**Key accomplishments:**
- Reduced main.rs from 4,580 to 3,688 lines through pure mechanical refactoring
- Created PR #1 and merged refactoring into main
- All behavioral tests preserved
- Demonstrated safe refactoring using REFACTORING_RULES.md

### Modules Successfully Extracted

1. **src/models.rs** - Core data structures (ZwiftEvent, EventSubGroup, UserStats, RouteData)
2. **src/category.rs** - Category functions and speed constants
3. **src/parsing.rs** - Text parsing utilities for distances and descriptions
4. **src/cache.rs** - User stats caching functionality

### Documentation Used

1. **REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Step-by-step mechanical extraction guide
2. **REFACTORING_RULES.md** - Behavioral contract enforced throughout
   - Pre-flight checklist to ensure clean state
   - 4 safe extractions with exact commands (models, category, parsing, cache)
   - Explicit refusal of complex modules (estimation, display, filtering, etc.)
   - Step-by-step mechanical copy-delete instructions
   - NO debugging allowed - immediate revert on test failure
   - Golden rule: "Tests failing = You failed, not the tests"

### Key Changes from Original Plans

**Original plans had dangerous phrases:**
- "Move functions preserving error handling" → Invites thinking
- "Move functions exactly as they are" → Still allows interpretation
- "If tests fail: debug, try again" → Violates core principle

**New plan uses only mechanical language:**
- "Copy entire file"
- "DELETE everything EXCEPT" (lists exact items)
- "USE ONLY DELETE KEY"
- "If ANY test fails: git checkout . && STOP"

### Safe Modules Ready to Extract

1. **models.rs** (lines 108-251) - Data structures only
2. **category.rs** (lines ~254-275) - Two pure functions
3. **parsing.rs** (lines ~143-220) - Pure parsing functions
4. **cache.rs** (lines ~656-847) - Isolated I/O functions

### Modules That MUST Be Refused

All remaining modules have complex interdependencies:
- estimation.rs - Critical mutations, circular dependencies
- display.rs - 600+ lines, many mutations
- filtering.rs - Core business logic
- commands.rs - Database interactions

Response if asked: "These complex refactorings require careful human review at each step. I cannot execute them automatically."

### Previous Session Summary (from earlier HANDOFF.md)

Created comprehensive refactoring documentation following a failed refactoring attempt that demonstrated AI's tendency to modify code behavior even with explicit "DO NOT CHANGE" instructions.

Previous accomplishments:
- REFACTORING_RULES.md - AI-focused behavioral contract
- REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md - Human understanding guide
- Property tests (7) and snapshot tests (10) for behavioral preservation
- Unified testing strategy document

### Project Status

- **Branch**: main (refactoring merged via PR #1)
- **Test Suite**: 89 tests all passing ✅
- **Code Structure**: Successfully modularized safe components into 4 modules
- **Mutation Testing**: Running on extracted modules (results pending)
- **Code Size**: main.rs reduced from 4,580 → 3,688 lines (19.5% reduction)
- **Remaining**: Complex modules (estimation, display, filtering) require human review

### Next Actions

1. **Monitor mutation testing results**:
   ```bash
   ./check_mutation_progress.sh
   # Or check individual logs:
   tail -f mutation_logs/*.log
   ```

2. **Review mutation testing outcomes**:
   ```bash
   # When complete, analyze survived mutants
   grep -l "Survived" mutants.out/*/outcome.json
   # These indicate potential gaps in test coverage
   ```

3. **Consider next refactorings** (with human oversight):
   - **Low Risk**: Display/formatting functions, statistics module, config enhancements
   - **Medium Risk**: API/HTTP module with careful error handling review  
   - **High Risk**: Duration estimation logic, event filtering (core business logic)
   - See SESSION_20250106_REFACTORING_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md for detailed analysis

### Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# Verify clean state
cd /home/jack/tools/rust/zwift-race-finder
git status  # Should be clean
git log --oneline -3  # See recent commits

# Check mutation testing results
./check_mutation_progress.sh

# If considering more refactoring
cat REFACTORING_RULES.md  # Review the behavioral contract
cat sessions/SESSION_20250106_REFACTORING_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md  # See analysis

# Run tests before any changes
cargo test  # All 89 should pass
```

### Key Files
- `REFACTORING_RULES.md` - The behavioral contract (critical for safe refactoring)
- `REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md` - Why AI tends to modify code during refactoring
- `src/main.rs` - Currently 3,688 lines (down from 4,580)
- `src/lib.rs` - Contains module declarations for extracted modules
- Mutation testing scripts:
  - `run_mutation_testing.sh` - Start background testing
  - `check_mutation_progress.sh` - Monitor progress

### Important Reminders
- Use ONLY mechanical copy-delete method
- NO debugging if tests fail - immediate revert
- Complex modules must be refused
- Tests are the specification
