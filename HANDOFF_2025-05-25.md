## Current State
Status: 29.6% prediction accuracy (was 92.8%)
Target: <20% accuracy
Latest: Discovered drop dynamics - getting dropped on hills explains variance

## Essential Context
- Heavy riders (86kg) get dropped on climbs, lose 33% draft benefit
- Binary state: with pack (30.9 km/h) OR solo (23-25 km/h)
- Bell Lap shows 82.6% variance (32-86 min) due to drops
- Current model assumes constant pack speed (wrong)
- Need dual-speed model: pack time + solo time

## Next Step
Implement calculate_drop_probability() based on route elevation profile

## If Blocked
Need to fix Bell Lap distance (14.1km not 45km) before testing
