Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/nyc_wko_2.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":4,"routeId":352245150,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-01T23:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3060,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6350841,"name":"Amalgam (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":4,"routeId":352245150,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":1,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-01T23:00:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-01T23:30:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-01T23:25:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-01T23:30:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-01T23:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3060,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Amalgam.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606239680702"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4992921,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1608424067131"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":4940369,"worldId":1,"name":"Workout 3 | Cadence in Control","description":"With longer outdoor rides just around the corner, it’s time to get ready to crush it with Zwift Camp: Inside Out.

He’s coached countless athletes to wins in Grand Tour stages and one-day Classics, including Mat Hayman’s 2016 Paris-Roubaix victory.\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level.

Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/nyc_wko_3.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":4,"routeId":1509089537,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T01:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3120,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351603,"name":"Arise (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":4,"routeId":1509089537,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":4,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T00:50:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T01:20:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T01:15:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T01:20:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T01:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3120,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Arise.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606239729316"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993864,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1666090367948"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":4963260,"worldId":1,"name":"Zwift Crit Racing Club - Glasgow Crit Circuit","description":"It's Crit time!

Starting off at mainly sub-threshold intensity, but progressing to very difficult 30/30s for the finale!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient Care, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach, a USA Cycling certified power based training coach, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the creator of Zwift's \"Build Me Up\" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching, please visit www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level.

The over/under intervals alternate between 2 min @88% FTP and 30 secs @110% FTP.  The 30/30s up the ante a bit and alternate between 30 secs @130% FTP and 30 secs @50% FTP.  Yes, there are rest breaks, but they are purposely short to keep the heart rate and metabolic demands up.  Better eat your sandwich quick before the bread gets soggy...\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient Care, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach, a USA Cycling certified power based training coach, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the creator of Zwift's \"Build Me Up\" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching, please visit www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other.

This ability to tolerate lactate only comes with precise intervals in training. We can all produce a one off effort to build lactate, but with carefully planned intervals we can maintain this high level of lactate for an extended period. This is where the training effect happens!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nKevin Poulton - With more than 20 years experience coaching athletes at the World Tour level, Kevin has spent the past two decades designing workouts and structured training plans to help cyclists achieve their goals. He’s coached countless athletes to wins in Grand Tour stages and one-day Classics, including Mat Hayman’s 2016 Paris-Roubaix victory.\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/ldn_wko_8.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":928793662,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T04:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3420,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351621,"name":"Lactate Shuttle (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":928793662,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":1,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T03:50:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T04:20:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T04:15:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T04:20:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T04:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3420,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Lactate_Shuttle.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606239800311"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993877,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1666090425692"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":5002222,"worldId":1,"name":"EVO CC Vortex Interval Ride [~3-3.8w/kg avg]","description":"Welcome to the Evolution Cycling Club [EVO] interval session.

Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/ldn_wko_10.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":1880443431,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T06:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3540,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351640,"name":"Macro to Micro (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":1880443431,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":1,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T05:50:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T06:20:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T06:15:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T06:20:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T06:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3540,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Macro_to_Micro.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606239816128"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993893,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1666090469071"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":5002237,"worldId":1,"name":"ZZRC Bring a Bidon Social Ride","description":"Welcome to our ZZRC Bring a Bidon 2.4-2.7. This is a group ride, not a race, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC was founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift .\n\nYELLOW BEACON will pace between 2.4-2.7 on the ride , with a possible increase of watts on inclines or sprints , but the average for the whole ride will be as advertised\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on most of our rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a fence ensures that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of falling off the back of the main group , you will need to pace well over group pace to bridge the gap and catch .\n\nThis is where our awesome ZZRC sweeps and Ride Buddies will help you return to group using their draft. They will give you clear encouraging instructions to aid this process .\n\nOur crew are a caring bunch who dedicated a lot of hours to this club , but want you to have the best ride experience on Zwift\n\nYou will be fully supported and encouraged throughout the ride by the Leader, Sweeps and Ride Buddies .\n\nOur rides do not allow the use of TT Bikes as they do not draft and will require you to push harder on the ride, and in these instances our Sweeps will not be able to help you .\n\nMountain bikes operate very similarly, minimum draft so more watts (effort) will be required for the ride and any chase backs to group .\n\nAll our rides have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to rejoin if you have technical issues or you find yourself out of the group in the early stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you back into the main group with our YELLOW BEACON .\n\n\nWe love to have a chat on our rides so join us\non Discord: https://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX\n\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to the ride leader (or just in front on climbs), don’t let a gap form and the elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence – We don’t like to fry anyone\n\n3) Most important of all . . . HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE RIDE.\n\n#zzrc\n\nDon’t forget to join our ZZRC-We Pace Not Race Facebook page and our club on the companion app","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/club-images/EVENT/47318024-59f4-4304-a4bf-5c3508cfcc3a","rulesId":256,"mapId":10,"routeId":136140280,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":3733288445,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T06:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3600,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":true,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351641,"name":"ZZRC Bring a Bidon Social Ride (C)","description":"","label":3,"subgroupLabel":"C","rulesId":256,"mapId":10,"routeId":136140280,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":3733288445,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":9,"invitedLeaders":[169966,189840,2423637],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":2.4,"toPaceValue":2.7,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T06:00:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T06:30:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T06:25:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T06:30:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T06:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3600,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":null,"overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zzrc","created_ryan","communityevent","fenced","steering","time_ahead_left=4","time_ahead_mid=12","time_ahead_right=30","doubledraft","timestamp=1743343226943"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVENT_ONLY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":7,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993894,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_RIDE","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":null,"restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zzrc","created_ryan","communityevent","fenced","steering","time_ahead_left=4","time_ahead_mid=12","time_ahead_right=30","doubledraft","timestamp=1743343226943"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":"clubs","microserviceExternalResourceId":"84d267c2-c68c-4242-bbba-a7dbb10d0299","microserviceEventVisibility":"PUBLIC","minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_RIDE"},{"id":4994781,"worldId":1,"name":"Pride On Ride ","description":"The Pride On group rides you know and love—led by incredible members of the LGBTQIA+ Zwifting community and their allies.

THIS WORKOUT\n\nAmalgam -5 different interval \"amalgams\" for your fitness pleasure! We'll mix it up today with position changes, pedal stroke work, longer threshold intervals, and the dreaded \"Shark Teeth'\"efforts!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient Care, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach, a USA Cycling certified power based training coach, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the creator of Zwift's \"Build Me Up\" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching, please visit www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/ldn_wko_8.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":1880443431,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T07:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3060,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351651,"name":"Amalgam (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":1880443431,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":1,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T06:50:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T07:20:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T07:15:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T07:20:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T07:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3060,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Amalgam.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606239849680"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993902,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1608424187301"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":5002243,"worldId":1,"name":"AERO Fit and Fun Steady State","description":"The AERO Fit and Fun Steady State is a group ride with some optional fun along the way.

We open with 6 x 2min Anaerobic Capacity efforts, however the target power increases from hard to very hard! The workout concludes with a 6min VO2 effort featuring the same steady increase in target power.\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nKevin Poulton - With more than 20 years experience coaching athletes at the World Tour level, Kevin has spent the past two decades designing workouts and structured training plans to help cyclists achieve their goals. He’s coached countless athletes to wins in Grand Tour stages and one-day Classics, including Mat Hayman’s 2016 Paris-Roubaix victory.\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level.

Please respect the pace set by the leader, this is a group ride not a race. #strongertogether\n\nFinally, if you are just starting your zwift experience, please join our facebook group and PACK Club for tips on group riding, friendly advice and to answer any questions you have.\n\nPACK Club:\nhttps://www.zwift.com/clubs/Pack/join\n\nFacebook Group #zwiftpack\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/zwiftpack/\n\nPACK Events:\nhttps://zwift.com/events/tag/pack\n\nDiscord Voice Chat:\nhttps://discord.gg/cce7ers\n\nZwiftpower Team:\nhttps://www.zwiftpower.com/team.php?id=2928","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/clubs/pack.jpg","rulesId":260,"mapId":1,"routeId":4009130866,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":91616735,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T08:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":0,"distanceInMeters":29800.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351672,"name":"PACK SUB2 Weekend Recovery (D)","description":"","label":4,"subgroupLabel":"D","rulesId":260,"mapId":1,"routeId":4009130866,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":91616735,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":13,"invitedLeaders":[1316961,963089,641326,1566018,1574221,3379720,65982,298884,283554],"invitedSweepers":[335342,4858486,936076,1785003,1561917,1724882,1447325,399653,670462,949498,1772571,440182],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.6,"toPaceValue":1.9,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T08:00:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T08:30:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T08:25:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T08:30:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T08:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":0,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":29800.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["NO_TT_BIKES","ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":null,"overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zwiftpack","fenced","time_ahead_left=12","time_ahead_mid=16","time_ahead_right=20","powerup_percent=\"3,1,5,99\"","pack","created_ryan","communityevent","strongpack","pd4_race_physics","timestamp=1724195718765"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVENT_ONLY","rulesSet":["NO_TT_BIKES","ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993916,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_RIDE","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":null,"restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zwiftpack","fenced","time_ahead_left=15","time_ahead_mid=30","time_ahead_right=60","powerup_percent=\"3,1,5,99\"","pack","created_ryan","communityevent","strongpack","pd4_race_physics","timestamp=1735738673691"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":"clubs","microserviceExternalResourceId":"1d85bfba-192a-47e9-9492-df752028fa15","microserviceEventVisibility":"PUBLIC","minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_RIDE"},{"id":5002259,"worldId":1,"name":"Brownlee Fitness Hare & Hounds ","description":"Brownlee Fitness welcomes you to a Monday hare and hounds style event where 4 groups leave at 1 minute intervals and try to catch the group in front.

The fence is used throughout the ride to keep everyone together. The fence will not kick you off the ride but we do encourage all our riders to stay together as close to the beacon as possible. Our rides offer a 30 minute late join option. All 505 rides come with complimentary access to an After Ride Party where you can ride extra distance with your fellow 505 teammates.\n\nThe yellow beacon team leader will ride the entirety of the ride as close to 2.8w/kg as possible. Some of the rides have a few minor climbs where the w/kg can fluctuate.\n\nOur rides offer sweepers to help pull you back to the blob if you need assistance. Please speak up during the ride if you are in need of a sweep. No speaky, no sweepy.\n\nTeam DIRT is an acronym for Dads Indoors Riding Trainers. The 505 rides began under the Team DIRT banner.

Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/ldn_wko_12.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":3599973269,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T10:25:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3120,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351724,"name":"Arise (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":3599973269,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":4,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T09:55:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T10:25:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T10:20:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T10:25:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T10:25:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3120,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Arise.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606239997156"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993940,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1608424217675"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":5002690,"worldId":1,"name":"Zwift Epic Race -

Same time next week with a new workout! \n\nNotes: \n\n- You will default to ERG mode.  If you prefer your smart trainer to not auto adjust resistance, deselect ERG in the menu before the ride to bring you to SIM mode ( https://support.zwift.com/en_us/erg-mode-in-workouts-SkQJC8OEH ) or you can change it in game. \n\n- The displayed peloton speed will be slower than anticipated. This will not affect your workout, but it is a quirky feature\n\nJoin us on Discord: https://discord.gg/QK9vVdFjUJ\n\nIf you have questions about tech set-up for zwift or cycling in general,\nplease feel free to message us on our social platforms, we would be happy\nto help you where we can!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/epictourgranfondo/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Epictourgranfondo\nhttps://www.strava.com/clubs/epic-tour\n\nEpictour is a cyclist-first company from Toronto, Canada, producing events,\ntraining programs and offering high-quality products.

Starting off at mainly sub-threshold intensity, but progressing to very difficult 30/30s for the finale!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient Care, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach, a USA Cycling certified power based training coach, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the creator of Zwift's \"Build Me Up\" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching, please visit www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level.

This is a group ride, not a race, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC was founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift .\n\nYELLOW BEACON will pace between 2-2.5 on the ride , with a possible increase of watts on inclines or sprints , but the average for the whole ride will be 2-2.5 .\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on most of our rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a fence ensures that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of falling off the back of the main group , you will need to pace well over group pace to bridge the gap and catch .\n\nThis is where our awesome ZZRC sweeps and Ride Buddies will help you return to group using their draft. They will give you clear encouraging instructions to aid this process .\n\nOur crew are a caring bunch who dedicated a lot of hours to this club , but want you to have the best ride experience on Zwift\n\nYou will be fully supported and encouraged throughout the ride by the Leader, Sweeps and Ride Buddies .\n\nOur rides do not allow the use of TT Bikes as they do not draft and will require you to push harder on the ride, and in these instances our Sweeps will not be able to help you .\n\nMountain bikes operate very similarly, minimum draft so more watts (effort) will be required for the ride and any chase backs to group .\n\nAll our rides have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to rejoin if you have technical issues or you find yourself out of the group in the early stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you back into the main group with our YELLOW BEACON .\n\n\nWe love to have a chat on our rides so join us on discord\n<https://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX>\nJoin the ZZRC Discord Server!<https://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX>\ndiscord.gg<https://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX>\n[favicon.ico]<https://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX>\n\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to the ride leader (or just in front on climbs), don’t let a gap form and the elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence – We don’t like to fry anyone\n\n3) Most important of all . . . HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE RIDE.\n\n#zzrc\n\nDon’t forget to join our ZZRC-We Pace Not Race Facebook page and our club on the companion app","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/club-images/EVENT/47318024-59f4-4304-a4bf-5c3508cfcc3a","rulesId":260,"mapId":9,"routeId":3302953739,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":3733288445,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T12:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":4500,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":true,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351775,"name":"ZZRC Espresso 2-2.5 Social Ride (D)","description":"","label":4,"subgroupLabel":"D","rulesId":260,"mapId":9,"routeId":3302953739,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":3733288445,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":13,"invitedLeaders":[4068613,2284919],"invitedSweepers":[1179401,2423637,4730237],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":2.0,"toPaceValue":2.5,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T12:00:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T12:30:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T12:25:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T12:30:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T12:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":4500,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["NO_TT_BIKES","ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zzrc","created_ryan","communityevent","fenced","time_ahead_left=6","time_ahead_mid=12","time_ahead_right=25","powerup_percent=\"1,50,5,50\"","timestamp=1724621918805"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVENT_ONLY","rulesSet":["NO_TT_BIKES","ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":7,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993970,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_RIDE","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":null,"restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zzrc","created_ryan","communityevent","fenced","time_ahead_left=8","time_ahead_mid=30","time_ahead_right=120","powerup_percent=\"1,50,5,50\"","timestamp=1742504612241"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":"clubs","microserviceExternalResourceId":"84d267c2-c68c-4242-bbba-a7dbb10d0299","microserviceEventVisibility":"PUBLIC","minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_RIDE"},{"id":5002691,"worldId":1,"name":"Zwift Epic Race -

The over/under intervals alternate between 2 min @88% FTP and 30 secs @110% FTP.  The 30/30s up the ante a bit and alternate between 30 secs @130% FTP and 30 secs @50% FTP.  Yes, there are rest breaks, but they are purposely short to keep the heart rate and metabolic demands up.  Better eat your sandwich quick before the bread gets soggy...\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient Care, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach, a USA Cycling certified power based training coach, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.

Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/ldn_wko_17.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":928793662,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T13:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3120,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351794,"name":"Ham Sandwich (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":928793662,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":1,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T13:00:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T13:30:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T13:25:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T13:30:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T13:30:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3120,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Ham_Sandwich.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606240062990"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993985,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1608424248628"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":4994782,"worldId":1,"name":"Pride On Ride ","description":"The Pride On group rides you know and love—led by incredible members of the LGBTQIA+ Zwifting community and their allies.

This ability to tolerate lactate only comes with precise intervals in training. We can all produce a one off effort to build lactate, but with carefully planned intervals we can maintain this high level of lactate for an extended period. This is where the training effect happens!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nKevin Poulton - With more than 20 years experience coaching athletes at the World Tour level, Kevin has spent the past two decades designing workouts and structured training plans to help cyclists achieve their goals. He’s coached countless athletes to wins in Grand Tour stages and one-day Classics, including Mat Hayman’s 2016 Paris-Roubaix victory.\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/ldn_wko_6.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":2694166390,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T14:00:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3420,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351803,"name":"Lactate Shuttle (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":2694166390,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":1,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T13:30:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T14:00:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T13:55:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T14:00:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T14:00:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3420,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Lactate_Shuttle.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606240081365"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4993989,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1608424263730"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":5002331,"worldId":1,"name":"MAAP In The Field: USA Group Ride ","description":"Join the MAAP crew each week, we’ll roll as a group at a moderate 2-2.5 w/kg pace.

This is a group ride, not a race, where we encourage riding together. \n\nIn 2015 ZZRC was founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift .\n\nYELLOW BEACON will pace between 2.5-2.7 on the ride , with a possible increase of watts on inclines or sprints  , but the average for the whole ride is as advertised\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on most of our rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a fence ensures that the ride is not over paced . \n\nIn the event of falling off the back of the main group , you will need to pace well over group pace to bridge the gap and catch . \n\nThis js a Cat C medium paced group ride . It is not a slow paced Cat D Ride . \n\nOur rides do not allow the use of TT Bikes as they do not draft and will require you to push harder on the ride, and in these instances our Sweeps will not be able to help you . \n\nMountain bikes operate very similarly, minimum draft so more watts (effort) will be required for the ride and any chase backs to group . \n\nAll our rides have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to rejoin if you have technical issues or you find yourself out of the group in the early stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you back into the main group with our YELLOW BEACON . \n\nSweepers are not in operation on this ride so please consider using late join in the first 30 mins or make a small group of your own. \n\nWe love to have a chat on our rides so join us on our dedicated discord \n  https://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to the ride leader (or just in front on climbs), don’t let a gap form and the elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence – We don’t like to fry anyone \n\n3) Most important of all . . . HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE RIDE.\n\n#zzrc\n\nDon’t forget to join our ZZRC-We Pace Not Race Facebook page and our club on the companion app ","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/club-images/EVENT/47318024-59f4-4304-a4bf-5c3508cfcc3a","rulesId":256,"mapId":6,"routeId":2843604888,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":3733288445,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T16:15:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":0,"distanceInMeters":26500.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":true,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351857,"name":"ZZRC Wrecked Legs - Post Weekend Recovery Ride (C)","description":"","label":3,"subgroupLabel":"C","rulesId":256,"mapId":6,"routeId":2843604888,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":3733288445,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":3,"invitedLeaders":[189840,2423637,77949,2839321,435044,305403],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":2.5,"toPaceValue":2.7,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T15:45:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T16:15:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T16:10:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T16:15:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T16:15:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":0,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":26500.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":null,"overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zzrc","created_ryan","communityevent","fenced","time_ahead_left=3","time_ahead_mid=10","time_ahead_right=30","doubledraft","steering","timestamp=1724687682239"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVENT_ONLY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":7,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4994023,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_RIDE","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":null,"restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["jerseyunlock","zzrc","created_ryan","communityevent","fenced","time_ahead_left=4","time_ahead_mid=12","time_ahead_right=30","doubledraft","timestamp=1742504639675"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":"clubs","microserviceExternalResourceId":"84d267c2-c68c-4242-bbba-a7dbb10d0299","microserviceEventVisibility":"PUBLIC","minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_RIDE"},{"id":4997868,"worldId":1,"name":"Stage 1: Cityscapes: Glasgow Crit Circuit || Advanced","description":"This month, it’s all about speed, skill, and navigating iconic urban circuits.

Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to: https://support.zwift.com/hc/en-us/articles/210208083-What-is-FTP-and-how-is-it-used-in-Zwift","shortName":null,"shortDescription":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/static/events_headers/cycling/workouts/ldn_wko_20.jpg","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":2694166390,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"visible":true,"overrideMapPreferences":true,"eventStart":"2025-06-02T16:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3540,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"laps":0,"privateEvent":false,"invisibleToNonParticipants":false,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"eventSubgroups":[{"id":6351861,"name":"Macro to Micro (E)","description":"#zwiftofficial","label":5,"subgroupLabel":"E","rulesId":256,"mapId":3,"routeId":2694166390,"routeUrl":null,"jerseyHash":null,"bikeHash":null,"startLocation":1,"invitedLeaders":[],"invitedSweepers":[],"paceType":1,"fromPaceValue":1.0,"toPaceValue":5.0,"fieldLimit":null,"registrationStart":"2025-06-02T15:50:00.000+0000","registrationEnd":"2025-06-02T16:20:00.000+0000","lineUpStart":"2025-06-02T16:15:00.000+0000","lineUpEnd":"2025-06-02T16:20:00.000+0000","eventSubgroupStart":"2025-06-02T16:20:00.000+0000","durationInSeconds":3540,"laps":0,"distanceInMeters":0.0,"signedUp":false,"signupStatus":0,"registered":false,"registrationStatus":0,"followeeEntrantCount":0,"totalEntrantCount":0,"followeeSignedUpCount":0,"totalSignedUpCount":0,"followeeJoinedCount":0,"totalJoinedCount":0,"auxiliaryUrl":"","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"https://cdn.zwift.com/events/upload/workouts/Macro_to_Micro.zwo","overrideMapPreferences":false,"tags":["timestamp=1606240100196"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"accessValidationResult":null,"accessRules":[],"rangeAccessLabel":null}],"eventSeries":null,"auxiliaryUrl":"","imageS3Name":null,"imageS3Bucket":null,"sport":"CYCLING","cullingType":"CULLING_EVERYBODY","rulesSet":["ALLOWS_LATE_JOIN"],"recurring":true,"recurringOffset":null,"publishRecurring":true,"parentId":4994026,"type":"EVENT_TYPE_GROUP_WORKOUT","workoutHash":null,"customUrl":"","restricted":false,"unlisted":false,"eventSecret":null,"accessExpression":null,"tags":["timestamp=1608424278502"],"lateJoinInMinutes":30,"timeTrialOptions":null,"microserviceName":null,"microserviceExternalResourceId":null,"microserviceEventVisibility":null,"minGameVersion":null,"recordable":false,"imported":false,"eventTemplateId":null,"categoryEnforcement":false,"rangeAccessLabel":null,"eventType":"GROUP_WORKOUT"},{"id":4993079,"worldId":1,"name":"Zwift TT Club Racing - Duchy Estate","description":"The Time Trial.
