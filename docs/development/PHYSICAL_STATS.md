# Physical Stats and Their Impact on Zwift Performance

## Why Physical Attributes Matter

### Weight (kg)
- **Power-to-weight ratio (w/kg)** is the primary determinant of climbing speed
- Heavier riders have an advantage on flats due to higher absolute power
- Lighter riders excel on climbs where w/kg matters most
- Affects drafting dynamics - heavier riders provide better draft

### Height (meters)
- **Aerodynamic drag** increases with frontal area (taller = more drag)
- **Drafting effectiveness** - taller riders get less benefit from the draft
- **CdA (drag coefficient Ã— area)** calculations in Zwift physics engine
- Affects speed on flats and descents more than climbs

## Jack's Stats
- Height: 1.82m (6'0")
- Weight: ~86kg (from race data)
- Zwift Racing Score: 195 (Cat D)

## Performance Implications

### On Flats
- Taller riders (like Jack at 1.82m) face more air resistance
- Need higher absolute power to maintain same speed as shorter riders
- Benefit less from pack dynamics

### On Climbs
- Weight becomes the dominant factor
- At 86kg, need strong w/kg to compete on climbs
- Height penalty is minimal on steep gradients

### Optimal Race Types
Given Jack's profile (1.82m, 86kg):
- Better suited to rolling/flat courses than pure climbing races
- Can leverage higher absolute power on flats
- Should focus on races with good draft opportunities
- Time trials may be challenging due to height/drag penalty

## Future Enhancements
- Use height/weight for more accurate speed predictions
- Adjust draft benefit calculations based on height
- Factor in CdA estimates for different positions
- Consider bike choice effects (TT vs road bike aerodynamics)
