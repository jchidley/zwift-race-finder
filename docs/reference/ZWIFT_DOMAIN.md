# Zwift Domain Knowledge

## Racing Categories

### Traditional Categories (A/B/C/D/E)
- **A**: Elite racers, typically 4.0+ w/kg FTP
- **B**: Strong racers, 3.2-3.9 w/kg
- **C**: Intermediate, 2.5-3.1 w/kg
- **D**: Beginner/recreational, <2.5 w/kg
- **E**: Recovery/social, no performance requirements

### Zwift Racing Score (ZRS)
- **Range**: 0-1000 (most riders 0-650)
- **Replaces**: Traditional categories in many events
- **Dynamic**: Updates based on recent performance
- **Granular**: No sandbagging, automatic placement
- **Brackets**: Events use score ranges (e.g., 200-299)

## Key Concepts

### Draft Benefit
- **Zwift**: ~33% power savings in pack
- **Real World**: ~25% power savings
- **Impact**: Staying with pack is crucial
- **Auto-Draft**: Enabled in races (no steering needed)

### Weight Impact
- **Flats**: Power matters most (heavier = advantage)
- **Climbs**: W/kg crucial (lighter = advantage)
- **Zwift Physics**: More polarized than real world
- **Typical Racer**: 70-75kg (Jack at 86kg = climb disadvantage)

### Route Types

#### Surface Types
- **Road**: Standard tarmac, most common
- **Dirt/Gravel**: Slower speeds, MTB events
- **Mixed**: Combination surfaces

#### Elevation Profiles
- **Flat**: <5m elevation per km
- **Rolling**: 5-10m/km
- **Hilly**: 10-15m/km
- **Mountainous**: >15m/km

### Event Types

#### Race
- Full draft enabled
- Results tracked
- Categories enforced
- Typically 20-60 minutes

#### Time Trial (TT)
- No draft benefit
- Individual effort
- Usually shorter
- Pure power test

#### Group Ride
- Social pace
- Leader controlled
- May have "race" segments
- Categories optional

#### Group Workout
- Structured training
- ERG mode common
- No racing
- Power targets

### Special Concepts

#### Lead-in Distance
- Distance before start/finish banner
- Not counted in lap distance
- Varies by event type (0.2-5.7km)
- Must be added to route distance for total

#### PowerUps
- Temporary boosts in races
- Feather (weight reduction) for climbs
- Aero boost for flats
- Draft boost for breakaways
- Strategic use important

#### Route Knowledge
- **Route ID**: Internal Zwift identifier
- **Stable**: Doesn't change with event renames
- **Discovery**: Found via ZwiftHacks, testing
- **Route 9999**: Placeholder for unknown

## Race Dynamics

### Pack Behavior
- **Sticky Draft**: Easier to stay in pack than real world
- **Blob Effect**: Large groups stay together on flats
- **Selection Points**: Hills cause splits
- **Binary State**: Either in pack or dropped

### Starting Strategy
- **Hard Start**: Most races start fast
- **Position Early**: Hard to move up later
- **Warm Up**: Critical for good start
- **Power-ups**: Grab early if possible

### Finishing
- **Sprint Module**: Often decides places
- **Bike Choice**: Aero for flat finish, light for uphill
- **Power-up Timing**: Save for final effort
- **Line Choice**: Inside line shorter

## Equipment Impact

### Bike Choice
- **Tron**: Best all-around (unlock at level 10)
- **Aero**: For flat races
- **Lightweight**: For climbing races
- **Gravel**: For mixed surface

### Wheels
- **Deep Section**: For flats
- **Lightweight**: For climbs
- **Disc**: Time trials only

### Impact on Time
- Equipment can save 30-90 seconds in a race
- More important in longer events
- Critical for competitive results

## Common Terms

- **ZwiftPower**: Third-party results tracking
- **Sandbagging**: Racing below your category
- **Weight Doping**: Entering false weight
- **Sticky Watts**: Power that holds you in draft
- **Flier**: Attack off the front
- **Autocat**: Automatic category enforcement
- **WTRL**: World Tactical Racing League
- **ZRL**: Zwift Racing League
- **Double Draft**: Events with enhanced draft effect
