# UOM Migration V2: Progress Summary

**Date**: 2025-06-08  
**Status**: Phase 0 Complete - Ready for Migration

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Golden Behavioral Baseline
- Generated 9,414 golden tests capturing current behavior
- Tests cover all estimation functions with various inputs
- Includes edge cases (unknown routes, extreme distances)
- Committed to git for permanent reference
- **File**: `tests/golden/baseline_20250608_140530.json`

### 2. ✅ Property-Based Tests
- Defined 9 behavioral invariants that must always hold
- Tests verify monotonicity, inverse relationships, boundaries
- Discovered and documented edge cases (very short distances → 0 min)
- All tests pass, documenting actual system behavior
- **File**: `tests/properties/behavioral_invariants.rs`

### 3. ✅ A/B Testing Framework
- Built comprehensive framework for comparing implementations
- Supports batch testing with detailed failure reporting
- Includes performance tracking and comparison
- Ready to use for UOM migration verification
- **Files**: `src/ab_testing.rs`, `tests/behavioral/ab_testing.rs`

### 4. ✅ Compatibility Dashboard
- Created reporting system for tracking behavioral preservation
- Generates markdown dashboards with divergence analysis
- Categorizes issues by severity (Critical/Minor/Performance)
- Calculates compatibility percentages and trends
- **File**: `src/compatibility.rs`

### 5. ✅ Fresh Branch from Main
- Created `feature/uom-migration-v2` branch
- Starting from clean main branch (no UOM code)
- All test infrastructure in place
- Ready to begin incremental migration

## Current State

We are now fully prepared to begin the UOM migration with:
- Behavioral baseline captured (9,414 tests)
- Property invariants defined (9 properties)
- A/B testing framework ready
- Compatibility tracking in place
- Clean branch for migration

## Next Steps

1. **Run mutation testing** on current code to identify weak assertions
2. **Begin function-by-function migration** starting with strongest tests
3. **Use A/B tests** to verify each function has 100% compatibility
4. **Generate compatibility reports** after each migration
5. **Only proceed** when current function shows zero divergence

## Key Principle

Following the uutils approach: **"Any difference with current behavior is a bug"**

This absolute commitment to behavioral preservation ensures users experience zero change while we improve the internal implementation with type safety.
