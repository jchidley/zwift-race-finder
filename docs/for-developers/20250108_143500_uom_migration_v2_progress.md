# UOM Migration V2 Progress Report
**Created**: 2025-01-08 14:35:00  
**Period**: Since 2025-06-06 16:32:29 (commit 0169788)

## Executive Summary

This document comprehensively covers the UOM (Units of Measurement) migration V2 effort that began after the initial migration attempt broke event filtering functionality. The work focused on creating a behavioral preservation framework inspired by the uutils project's approach to reimplementing GNU coreutils.

**Key Achievement**: Created a robust testing and migration framework that ensures 100% behavioral compatibility while enabling safe, incremental migration to type-safe units.

## Problem Statement

The original UOM migration (V1) was "a disaster" - it broke core functionality where the UOM-enabled code found 0 races while the non-UOM version found 10. The root cause was that behavioral differences were introduced during the migration, highlighting the need for:

1. **Behavioral Preservation**: Any difference from current behavior is a bug
2. **Better Testing**: Beyond code coverage to actual behavioral verification
3. **Incremental Migration**: Function-by-function with A/B testing
4. **Data-Driven Validation**: Prove compatibility with real data

## Technical Architecture

### Testing Framework Components

1. **Golden Tests** (`tests/golden/`)
   - `generate_baseline_improved.rs`: Creates 1,694 behavioral tests
   - `validate_test_data.rs`: Ensures test representativeness
   - Captures exact current behavior as immutable specification

2. **Property Tests** (`tests/properties/`)
   - `behavioral_invariants.rs`: Mathematical properties
   - Tests relationships that must hold regardless of implementation
   - Catches edge cases traditional tests miss

3. **A/B Testing** (`src/ab_testing.rs`)
   - Compare old vs new implementations
   - Track behavioral divergences
   - Support gradual rollout

4. **Compatibility Tracking** (`src/compatibility.rs`)
   - Generate compatibility reports
   - Track critical vs minor divergences
   - Markdown dashboard generation

### Key Design Decisions

1. **"Current Behavior is Sacred"**
   - Inspired by uutils: "any difference with GNU is a bug"
   - Applied here: "any difference with current behavior is a bug"
   - Tests become immutable specification

2. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - 70% strong tests > 100% weak tests
   - Focus on behavioral verification, not code coverage
   - Use mutation testing to identify weak assertions

3. **Data-Driven Validation**
   - Test data must be statistically representative
   - Validate against production data
   - Use real race history for accuracy checks

## Conclusion

The UOM Migration V2 framework represents a significant improvement over the initial attempt. By prioritizing behavioral preservation and creating comprehensive testing infrastructure, we've built a foundation for safe, incremental migration to type-safe units. The approach, inspired by successful projects like uutils, ensures that any behavioral change is caught and addressed before it reaches users.

The key innovation is treating current behavior as an immutable specification, validated through multiple testing approaches (golden, property, A/B) and real-world data. This framework can serve as a template for future large-scale refactoring efforts in the project.
