# Test Reorganization Summary

Date: 2025-01-06

## Overview

This document summarizes the test reorganization work done to improve the codebase structure by moving tests to their appropriate modules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Duration Estimation Tests

Moved 6 tests from `main.rs` to `duration_estimation.rs`:
- `test_duration_estimation_for_cat_d()` - Tests category D duration calculations
- `test_get_route_difficulty_multiplier()` - Tests route name-based multipliers
- `test_specific_route_multipliers()` - Tests route difficulty calculations
- `test_edge_case_estimations()` - Tests edge cases (sprint, gran fondo, etc.)
- `test_more_elevation_multipliers()` - Additional elevation-based multiplier tests
- Fixed edge case test bug (0.1km with 1m elevation = 10m/km should be 0.9 multiplier)

### 2. Existing Test Organization

Found that several modules already have comprehensive test coverage:
- `event_filtering.rs` - 16 tests for filtering functions
- `parsing.rs` - 5 tests for parsing functions
- `category.rs` - Tests for category-related functions
- `route_discovery.rs` - Tests for route discovery
- `database.rs` - Tests for database operations
- `secure_storage.rs` - Tests for secure storage

### 3. Tests That Should Stay in main.rs

Integration tests that orchestrate multiple modules:
- `test_filter_events()` - Main filtering pipeline
- `test_prepare_event_row()` - Event display preparation
- `test_display_filter_stats()` - Filter statistics
- `test_generate_no_results_suggestions()` - User suggestions
- Various mutation testing edge cases

## Findings

### Code Duplication

Found duplication between main.rs and estimation.rs:
- `get_route_data_from_db()` exists in both files
- `get_route_data_fallback()` in main.rs duplicates logic in estimation.rs
- This duplication should be resolved in a future refactoring

### Test Organization Principles

1. **Unit tests with their module** - Each function tested where defined
2. **Integration tests in main.rs** - Multi-module orchestration tests
3. **Regression tests separate** - Complex regression tests in their own module
4. **Test helpers local** - Helper functions duplicated where needed

## Future Work

1. **Remove duplicate tests from main.rs** - The moved tests still exist in main.rs and should be removed
2. **Resolve code duplication** - Remove duplicate functions between main.rs and estimation.rs
3. **Extract test utilities** - Consider shared test_utils module for common helpers
4. **Add property-based tests** - For better edge case coverage
5. **Add benchmarks** - For performance-critical paths

## Test Coverage Status

All tests passing except:
- Pre-existing Mt. Fuji duration estimation test (unrelated to reorganization)

## Commands for Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
cargo test

# Module-specific tests
cargo test --lib duration_estimation::tests
cargo test --lib event_filtering::tests
cargo test --lib parsing::tests

# Integration tests only
cargo test --bin zwift-race-finder
```
