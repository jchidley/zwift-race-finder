## üéØ Key Milestones

### The Accuracy Journey
1. **92.8% Error** - Initial category-based estimates
2. **31.2% Error** - Discovered we were comparing estimates to estimates
3. **25.1% Error** - Integrated real Strava times
4. **36.9% Error** - Added pack dynamics model
5. **25.7% Error** - Fixed route mapping errors
6. **23.6% Error** - Current state with proper calibration

### Major Discoveries
- ZwiftPower times were estimates, not actuals
- Pack dynamics are binary (with pack or dropped)
- Route IDs more reliable than names
- Multi-lap races need special handling
- Draft benefit crucial for accuracy

### Technical Evolution
- Started with simple HTTP requests
- Added SQLite for persistence
- Integrated Strava for real times
- Built regression test suite
- Implemented mutation testing

## üìä Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- Empirical approach with real data
- Regression testing against actual races
- Simple algorithms over complex models
- Route ID as primary identifier

### What Didn't
- ZwiftPower scraping (data quality issues)
- Pure physics models (127% error)
- Category position tracking
- Complex ML approaches

### Key Insights
1. **Real data beats assumptions**
2. **Simple models can be accurate**
3. **Test quality matters more than quantity**
4. **User needs drive features**
