# Category Racing - Optimizing for Your Division

*Status: Outline Only - This guide needs data from each category to develop specific strategies*

## Overview

Each Zwift racing category has its own dynamics, optimal strategies, and common pitfalls. This guide will help you race smarter in your category.

## Category Overview (Racing Score Based)

### Category A (400+)
*Section to be developed*
- Typical speeds
- Race dynamics
- Common strategies

### Category B (300-399)
*Section to be developed*
- Field characteristics
- Power requirements
- Tactical considerations

### Category C (200-299)
*Section to be developed*
- Diverse field dynamics
- Equipment importance
- Positioning strategies

### Category D (0-199)
**Some initial data available:**
- Pack speed: ~30.9 km/h
- Solo speed: ~23.8 km/h
- High importance of staying with pack
- Diverse abilities within category

## Universal Category Principles

### The Bottom Third
- Harder to stay with pack
- Better draft opportunities
- Learn from faster riders
- High risk, high reward

### The Middle Third
- Balanced competition
- Can influence race
- Strategic options available
- Sweet spot for many

### The Top Third
- Easier to stay in front
- Less draft benefit
- May need to do more work
- Risk of upgrading

## Category-Specific Tactics (To Be Developed)

### Sprint Finishes by Category
*Data needed on:*
- Typical sprint powers
- Positioning importance
- Lead-out dynamics

### Climbing Strategies
*Analysis required for:*
- W/kg requirements
- Where selection happens
- Recovery abilities

### Time Trials
*Category differences in:*

## Common Category Mistakes

### Moving Up Too Fast
- Not ready for pace increase
- Lost in bigger fields
- Demotivating results

### Sandbagging Too Long
- Not improving racecraft
- Missing competitive races
- Ethical considerations

## Equipment Considerations by Category

### Lower Categories (C/D)
- Basic equipment often sufficient
- Fitness > Equipment
- Focus on consistent power

### Higher Categories (A/B)
- Equipment optimization matters more
- Marginal gains add up
- Level requirements important

## Training Focus by Category

*To be developed based on:*
- Typical fitness levels
- Common weaknesses
- Progression paths

## Data Collection Needed

To complete this guide, we need:
1. Average speeds by category
2. Typical power profiles
3. Race winning strategies
4. Field size effects
5. Common workout approaches

## Category Progression

*Future section on:*
- When to move up
- Preparing for next category
- Maintaining competitiveness

## Community Input
