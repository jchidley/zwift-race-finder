# Power Optimization - Managing Your Only Variable

*Status: Initial Concepts - This document will expand based on racing experience and user feedback*

## Core Principle

Once a Zwift race starts, you control exactly ONE thing: your power output. Everything else was decided before the gun went off. This guide helps you use those watts wisely.

## The Fundamental Question

**"How do I distribute my available watts to minimize my race time?"**

## Power Distribution Strategies (Initial Concepts)

### 1. The Pack Premium
- **Concept**: Watts spent staying with the pack are worth 33% more than solo watts
- **Implication**: Sometimes it's worth going over threshold to stay with the group
- **Trade-off**: Short-term suffering vs long-term advantage

### 2. The Binary State
Our data shows you're either:
- **WITH the pack** (getting draft benefit)
- **OFF the back** (time trialing alone)

There's rarely an in-between. Plan accordingly.

### 3. Critical Moments
Based on route analysis, power is most critical:
- **Race start**: Position yourself well
- **First climb**: Where selection happens
- **Technical sections**: Where gaps form
- **Final kilometer**: If you're still with the group

## Category-Specific Insights (To Be Expanded)

### Cat D (Under 200 Racing Score)
- Pack speed: ~30.9 km/h
- Solo speed: ~23.8 km/h
- **Key insight**: The pack is 30% faster - do whatever it takes to stay in

### Other Categories
*Data collection in progress for B/C/A categories*

## Practical Application

### Before the Race
1. Know your numbers:
   - FTP (Functional Threshold Power)
   - 5-minute power
   - 1-minute power
   
2. Study the route:
   - Where are the climbs?
   - How long are they?
   - Where might you get dropped?

### During the Race
1. **Start**: Don't get dropped in the first 2 minutes
2. **Steady sections**: Recover when possible
3. **Key moments**: Be ready to exceed threshold
4. **If dropped**: Settle into time trial mode

## Power vs Weight: The Eternal Question

- **Flats**: Raw watts matter most
- **Climbs**: Watts/kg is king
- **Descents**: Recover time
- **Overall**: Stay with the pack trumps everything

## Tools and Metrics (Future Section)

*This section will expand to cover:*
- Power meters and trainers
- Real-time decision making
- Post-race analysis
- Training implications

## Community Input Needed

This guide is in early development. We need data on:
- Typical power profiles for successful races
- Category-specific strategies
- Route-specific power requirements
- Recovery strategies

## Next Steps

1. Collect more race data
2. Analyze successful vs unsuccessful races
3. Build category-specific power profiles
4. Create route-specific guides
