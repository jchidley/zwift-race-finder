# Draft Strategies - Maximizing Your 24-33% Power Savings

*Status: Early Draft - This document will expand with specific positioning tactics and field dynamics*

## The Draft Advantage in Zwift

Zwift provides 24-33% power savings when drafting, compared to ~25% in real life. This extra benefit makes draft tactics even more critical in virtual racing.

## Basic Draft Principles

### The Draft Zone
- **Range**: Approximately 2-3 bike lengths behind another rider
- **Width**: Narrow - you need to be directly behind
- **Visual cue**: Your avatar sits up when drafting successfully

### Power Savings by Position
Based on Zwift's Pack Dynamics 4.1:
- **Directly behind one rider**: ~24% savings
- **In the pack**: Up to 33% savings
- **Optimal position**: 3-5 riders back in a group

## Field Size Effects (Key Insight)

### Small Fields (< 10 riders)
- Draft is inconsistent
- Attacks more likely to succeed
- Position changes matter more
- Higher variance in results

### Medium Fields (10-30 riders)
- Sweet spot for consistent draft
- Attacks need to be well-timed
- Pack tends to stay together longer
- Positioning is critical

### Large Fields (30+ riders)
- Very consistent draft available
- Attacks rarely succeed early
- Pack dynamics dominate
- Crashes through the field on climbs

## Tactical Applications

### When to Fight for Position
1. **Before climbs**: Get near front before gradients
2. **Technical sections**: Avoid accordion effect
3. **Final 5km**: Begin moving up
4. **Sprint setup**: Critical final kilometer

### When to Sit In
1. **Early race**: Save energy
2. **Steady sections**: Recovery time
3. **When well-positioned**: Don't waste watts
4. **After efforts**: Get back in draft ASAP

## The Drop Decision

Sometimes you must decide:
- **Fight to stay on**: Short climb, worth the effort?
- **Let them go**: Save energy for your own pace?

Key factors:
- How long is the effort?
- How far to the finish?
- Can you catch back on descent?
- Are others also struggling?

## Draft Myths vs Reality

### Myth: "Stay at the very back to save most energy"
**Reality**: You risk getting dropped in surges

### Myth: "Be on the front to control pace"
**Reality**: You're giving everyone else free speed

### Myth: "Draft doesn't matter on climbs"
**Reality**: Still 10-15% benefit on gradients

## Practical Draft Tips (To Be Expanded)

1. **Watch the w/kg display**: Shows pack effort
2. **Use the minimap**: See gaps forming
3. **Listen for attacks**: Audio cues matter
4. **Know your limits**: When to let the pack go
