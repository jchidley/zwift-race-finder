# Route Tactics - Power Distribution for Different Profiles

*Status: Placeholder with Basic Ideas - Route-specific strategies will be added as data is collected*

## Core Concept

Different routes reward different power distributions. Knowing where to spend your watts is as important as having them.

## Route-Specific Blob Dynamics

Understanding how the blob behaves on different terrain is crucial:

### Flat Routes - Blob Dominates
- Breakaways have <5% success rate
- Blob speeds 2-3 km/h faster than realistic
- Only option: perfect sprint positioning
- PowerUps: Save everything for finale

### Rolling Routes - Selection Points
- Blob fragments on steep pitches
- Reforms on descents/flats
- 3-5 rider breaks can work between climbs
- Watch for elastic effect

### Mountain Routes - Blob Dissolves
- Natural selection by W/kg
- Solo efforts more viable (>7% gradients)
- Small groups form organically
- Less "blob effect" advantage

### Technical Sections - Opportunities
- Dirt/gravel breaks up blob
- Tight turns create gaps
- Surface changes cause selections
- Attack timing crucial

## Route Categories

### Flat Routes
**Examples**: Tempus Fugit, Tick Tock
- **Power focus**: Steady state, high raw watts
- **Draft importance**: Critical - never lose the pack
- **Key moments**: Start and finish only
- **Strategy**: Conserve early, position late

### Rolling Routes  
**Examples**: Watopia Hilly, Sand and Sequoias
- **Power focus**: Repeated short efforts
- **Draft importance**: Very high on flats between climbs
- **Key moments**: Each hill can cause selection
- **Strategy**: Know which hills matter

### Mountain Routes
**Examples**: Alpe du Zwift, Ventoux
- **Power focus**: Sustained W/kg
- **Draft importance**: Less critical (lower speeds)
- **Key moments**: Early slopes set the groups
- **Strategy**: Find your rhythm, ignore others

### Mixed Routes
**Examples**: Four Horsemen, PRL Full
- **Power focus**: Everything - endurance test
- **Draft importance**: Varies by section
- **Key moments**: Multiple selection points
- **Strategy**: Segment-specific planning

## Specific Route Tactics (To Be Developed)

### Watopia Routes
*Data collection in progress for:*
- Volcano Circuit
- Jungle Circuit
- Epic KOM routes

### Makuri Islands
*Analysis pending for:*
- Neokyo routes
- Countryside tours

### Guest Worlds
*Seasonal analysis when available*

## Power Distribution Patterns

### The Negative Split Approach
- Conservative first half
- Increase effort gradually
- Strong finish
- **Best for**: Long races, unknown competition

### The Fast Start Method
- Go with the front group
- Settle into rhythm
- Survive to finish
- **Best for**: Short races, known fields

### The Selective Effort Strategy
- Save energy on certain sections
- Attack specific segments
- Recover between efforts
- **Best for**: Rolling routes, breakaway attempts

## Elevation-Based Planning

### Climbing Power Rules of Thumb
- **< 3%**: Stay with pack, raw watts matter
- **3-6%**: W/kg becomes important, draft still ~15%
- **> 6%**: Pure W/kg, draft minimal but still present
- **> 7%**: Blob advantage minimized, solo attacks viable
- **Descents**: Limited recovery - gradients halved in Zwift!

### Critical Attack Timing - Different from Road!

**Climbing Attacks**:
> "The bottom of most climbs on Zwift are often not very steep. No, the hard ramp usually happens in the middle. That's when I like to go, when it gets really hard."

- **Don't attack at the base** like in road racing
- **Wait for steep sections** (usually mid-climb)
- **Watch gradient changes** for selection points
- **PowerUp timing**: Save feather for the steep pitch

**Descent Attacks**:
> "A downhill attack does not start on the downhill. No, it starts at the last little kick rolling into the crest of the hill."

- **Attack BEFORE the descent** starts
- **Carry speed over the top** - crucial in Zwift
- **Remember**: Gradients halved (8% feels like 4%)
- **No coasting benefit** - must maintain power

### Critical Climb Analysis
For each major route, we need:
- Climb locations and gradients
- Typical selection points
- Power requirements by category
- Recovery opportunities

## Route Knowledge Database (Future)

Building a database of:
- Exact route profiles
- Typical race dynamics
- Power requirements
- Winning strategies

## Community Input Needed

Share your experience with:
- Specific route strategies
- Power data from races
- Where selection happens
- Successful tactics

## Tools for Route Analysis

- Zwift Insider route profiles
- Strava segment data
- Race result patterns
- Power file analysis

*This guide will expand significantly as route-specific data is collected. Each major route will eventually have its own detailed tactical guide.*
