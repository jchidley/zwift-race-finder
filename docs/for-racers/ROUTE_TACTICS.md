# Route Tactics - Power Distribution for Different Profiles

*Status: Placeholder with Basic Ideas - Route-specific strategies will be added as data is collected*

## Core Concept

Different routes reward different power distributions. Knowing where to spend your watts is as important as having them.

## Route Categories

### Flat Routes
**Examples**: Tempus Fugit, Tick Tock
- **Power focus**: Steady state, high raw watts
- **Draft importance**: Critical - never lose the pack
- **Key moments**: Start and finish only
- **Strategy**: Conserve early, position late

### Rolling Routes  
**Examples**: Watopia Hilly, Sand and Sequoias
- **Power focus**: Repeated short efforts
- **Draft importance**: Very high on flats between climbs
- **Key moments**: Each hill can cause selection
- **Strategy**: Know which hills matter

### Mountain Routes
**Examples**: Alpe du Zwift, Ventoux
- **Power focus**: Sustained W/kg
- **Draft importance**: Less critical (lower speeds)
- **Key moments**: Early slopes set the groups
- **Strategy**: Find your rhythm, ignore others

### Mixed Routes
**Examples**: Four Horsemen, PRL Full
- **Power focus**: Everything - endurance test
- **Draft importance**: Varies by section
- **Key moments**: Multiple selection points
- **Strategy**: Segment-specific planning

## Specific Route Tactics (To Be Developed)

### Watopia Routes
*Data collection in progress for:*
- Volcano Circuit
- Jungle Circuit
- Epic KOM routes

### Makuri Islands
*Analysis pending for:*
- Neokyo routes
- Countryside tours

### Guest Worlds
*Seasonal analysis when available*

## Power Distribution Patterns

### The Negative Split Approach
- Conservative first half
- Increase effort gradually
- Strong finish
- **Best for**: Long races, unknown competition

### The Fast Start Method
- Go with the front group
- Settle into rhythm
- Survive to finish
- **Best for**: Short races, known fields

### The Selective Effort Strategy
- Save energy on certain sections
- Attack specific segments
- Recover between efforts
- **Best for**: Rolling routes, breakaway attempts

## Elevation-Based Planning

### Climbing Power Rules of Thumb
- **< 3%**: Stay with pack, raw watts matter
- **3-6%**: W/kg becomes important
- **> 6%**: Pure W/kg, draft minimal
- **Descents**: Recovery time, stay tucked

### Critical Climb Analysis
For each major route, we need:
- Climb locations and gradients
- Typical selection points
- Power requirements by category
- Recovery opportunities

## Route Knowledge Database (Future)

Building a database of:
- Exact route profiles
- Typical race dynamics
- Power requirements
- Winning strategies

## Community Input Needed

Share your experience with:
- Specific route strategies
- Power data from races
- Where selection happens
- Successful tactics

## Tools for Route Analysis

- Zwift Insider route profiles
- Strava segment data
- Race result patterns
- Power file analysis
