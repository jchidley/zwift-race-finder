# Group Size Quick Reference Matrix

A quick lookup guide for group size dynamics in Zwift racing.

## Group Size Comparison

| Group Size | Real World Benefit | Zwift Benefit | Success Rate | Best Use Case | Power Requirement |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Solo** | Hard but possible | Very difficult | <5% | Steep climbs >7% only | 130-150% of blob |
| **2 riders** | Good draft (30%) | 25% savings | 10% | Emergency bridge | 120-130% of blob |
| **3-5 riders** | Optimal (40-50%) | Best breakaway (35%) | 20-30% | Coordinated attacks | 110-120% of blob |
| **6-10 riders** | Very good (50%+) | Churn begins | 15% | Selection moves | 105-115% of blob |
| **11-20 riders** | Excellent | Mini-blob forming | 10% | Natural selection | 100-110% of blob |
| **20-50 riders** | Peloton benefits | Full blob speed | N/A | Main pack riding | 75-85% (if positioned well) |
| **50+ riders** | Maximum benefit | Blob dynamics | N/A | Conservation mode | 70-80% (optimal position) |

## Terrain-Specific Recommendations

### Flat Courses
- **Optimal**: Stay in largest blob (20+ riders)
- **Breakaway**: Only 5+ coordinated riders have a chance
- **Solo**: Never attempt
- **Key**: Aerodynamics dominate

### Rolling Hills
- **Optimal**: 3-5 rider breaks on terrain changes
- **Blob strategy**: Position near front before rises
- **Solo**: Only on steepest pitches
- **Key**: Timing at crests

### Mountain Stages
- **Optimal**: Solo or duo on gradients >7%
- **Groups**: Fragment naturally on climbs
- **Blob**: Loses advantage on steep sections
- **Key**: Pure w/kg matters most

### Mixed/Technical
- **Optimal**: 3-5 riders through technical sections
- **Blob**: Fragments at surface changes
- **Solo**: Possible in chaos
- **Key**: Positioning before technical sections

## Decision Flow Chart

```
Race Situation Assessment:
│
├─ Am I in the main blob (20+ riders)?
│  ├─ YES → Check position
│  │  ├─ Front 15 → Maintain, watch for moves
│  │  └─ Back half → Move up urgently
│  └─ NO → Assess gap
│     ├─ <10 seconds → Bridge hard (solo)
│     ├─ 10-30 seconds → Find allies to bridge
│     └─ >30 seconds → Accept situation, maximize result
│
├─ Is a break forming?
│  ├─ 2 riders → Usually ignore (low success)
│  ├─ 3-5 riders → Assess strength
│  │  ├─ Similar w/kg → Consider joining
│  │  └─ Stronger → Let them go
│  └─ 6+ riders → This is a split, must respond
│
└─ Should I attack?
   ├─ Climb >7% → Solo viable
   ├─ 3-5 similar riders → Coordinate break
   ├─ Final 2km → Solo possible
   └─ Otherwise → Stay in blob
```

## PowerUp Usage by Group Size

| Group Size | Feather | Aero | Draft Boost |
|------------|---------|------|-------------|
| Solo | Climbs | Flats/Sprint | Rarely useful |
| 2 riders | Share climbs | Initial attack | When following |
| 3-5 riders | Coordinate | Rotation | Maintain speed |
| 6-10 riders | Individual use | Key moments | In draft |
| 20+ blob | Save for selection | Final sprint | Rarely needed |

## Time Gap Guidelines

### How long can different sized groups survive?

| Gap to Blob | Solo | 2 Riders | 3-5 Riders | 6-10 Riders |
|-------------|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| 5 seconds | 30s | 1 min | 2 min | 5 min |
| 10 seconds | 1 min | 2 min | 5 min | 10 min |
| 20 seconds | 2 min | 5 min | 10+ min | Probably safe |
| 30+ seconds | Climb only | 10 min | Often survives | Usually safe |

## Success Rate Factors

### High Success (>30%)
- 3-5 riders, all similar strength
- Late race attack (final 20%)
- Significant climb involved
- Blob is disorganized

### Medium Success (15-30%)
- Well-timed attack at pinch point
- 4-6 riders with good coordination
- Rolling terrain advantages
- 15-30 seconds gap established

### Low Success (<15%)
- Solo on flat terrain
- Mismatched group abilities
- Early race attacks
- Against organized blob

## Quick Power Reference

**Your FTP vs Effort Required**:
- **Solo attack**: 120-130% FTP for 5-10 minutes
- **Small break**: 105-115% FTP for 15-25 minutes
- **Blob (poor position)**: 85-95% FTP sustainable
- **Blob (good position)**: 70-80% FTP sustainable

## One-Minute Decision Guide

**See a gap forming?**
- Count riders immediately
- Check your current power vs FTP
- Assess terrain ahead
- Make decision in <5 seconds

**In a break?**
- Monitor gap constantly
- Share work equally
- Watch for passengers
- Commit or return quickly

**In the blob?**
- Position >15th? Move up
- Climb coming? Move forward early
- Feeling strong? Watch for 3-5 rider moves
- Feeling weak? Maintain position, minimize efforts

Remember: In Zwift, group size directly impacts your power requirements and chances of success. Choose wisely!
