# Racing Research Summary

A quick reference guide to all our key findings about Zwift racing tactics and physics.

## Key Research Findings

### Draft and Aerodynamics
- **Real world**: 30-40% savings behind one rider, up to 90-95% in pelotons [[CFD studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610518303751)]
- **Zwift**: 25-35% maximum savings, binary model (in or out)
- **No 8-rider limit** found in documentation
- **Blob effect**: Large groups go 2-3 km/h faster than physics predicts

### Optimal Group Sizes
- **Real world breakaway**: 5-7 riders optimal [[Sports Engineering](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12283-018-0270-5)]
- **Zwift breakaway**: 3-5 riders (less churn, better coordination)
- **Success rates**: ~30% real world, ~10-15% Zwift
- **Power requirement**: 110-120% of blob average in Zwift

### Attack Timing - Critical Differences
**Climbing**:
> "The hard ramp usually happens in the middle. That's when I like to go"
- Attack mid-climb in Zwift, not at base like road racing

**Descending**:
> "A downhill attack starts at the last little kick rolling into the crest"
- Attack BEFORE descent due to halved gradients

### Physics Modifications
- **Descent gradients halved**: 8% feels like 4%
- **No braking in races**: Removed for more realistic descents
- **Binary draft**: No gradual falloff with distance
- **Sticky draft**: Can get trapped, need surge to escape

### Race Dynamics
- **"Like crit racing at 3x speed"**: Everything compressed and intensified
- **Instant starts**: No neutral roll-out, 150-200% FTP first minute
- **Perfect information**: See everyone's w/kg in real-time
- **PowerUps**: Mandatory tactical layer (aero for sprints essential)

## Quick Decision Guide

### When to Attack
✅ **Solo**: Climbs >7%, final 1-2km, technical sections
✅ **3-5 riders**: Rolling terrain, 15-25km from finish, coordinated efforts
❌ **Never**: Flat roads solo, against organized blob, early in race

### Positioning Strategy
- **Optimal blob position**: Rows 5-15
- **Pre-climb**: Move to top 10 thirty seconds before
- **Sprint**: Top 5 by 1km to go, top 3 by 500m
- **Movement**: Micro-sprints (2-3 pedal strokes)

### Power Management
| Situation | Power Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Solo attack | 130-150% of blob |
| 3-5 rider break | 110-120% of blob |
| Good blob position | 75-85% of front |
| Poor blob position | 90-95% of front |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Road Racers in Zwift
1. Attacking at climb bases (wait for steep section)
2. Trying to coast on descents (gradients halved)
3. Gradual positioning moves (binary draft needs decisive action)
4. Ignoring PowerUps (essential for winning)
5. Fighting the physics (accept it as a game)

### General Mistakes
1. Going solo on flats (almost never works)
2. Wrong group size (too big = chaos, too small = caught)
3. Poor timing (early attacks rarely succeed)
4. Bad positioning (back of blob = dropped risk)
5. Wasting PowerUps (save for decisive moments)

## Key Tactical Principles

1. **Position > Power**: Good position saves 25-35% effort
2. **Timing > Strength**: Right moment beats raw watts
3. **Groups > Solo**: 3-5 riders optimal for breaks
4. **Accept the game**: Don't fight unique physics
5. **Binary thinking**: You're drafted or you're not

## Essential Quotes

**On Zwift's Nature**:
> "Virtual racing is just like real life racing at 3X speed"

**On Success**:
> "Smart watts winning more often than high watts"

**On Adaptation**:
> "It's a video game" - Accept and exploit the rules

## The Bottom Line

Success in Zwift requires:
1. Understanding the unique physics (binary draft, blob effect)
2. Adapting tactics (mid-climb attacks, pre-crest descents)
3. Mastering positioning (rows 5-15, micro-sprints)
4. Smart group selection (3-5 for breaks, 20+ for draft)
5. PowerUp discipline (save for key moments)

Remember: Zwift rewards those who master its actual rules, not those who wish it was outdoor cycling.
