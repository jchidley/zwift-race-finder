# Session 20250613_200046
Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done
- **Gymnasticon Bot Mode Setup**: Successfully configured and debugged gymnasticon virtual bike for Zwift testing
  - Resolved Bluetooth permission issues with `setcap` command
  - Fixed UDP control by identifying duplicate bind() call in built code
  - Built from source with proper debug logging
  - Confirmed UDP control working with correct syntax: `echo '{"power":250}' | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 3000`
  - Discovered connection reliability varies between Bluetooth and ANT+
  - Created comprehensive documentation for setup and troubleshooting

- **From Previous Checkpoint (190515)**:
  - Created comprehensive calibration guide with field-specific preprocessing details
  - Built multiple calibration tools (vision AI, PaddleOCR, multi-pass detection)
  - Tested and validated manual 1920x1080 config with debug_ocr tool
  - Updated OCR strategy document with key technical discoveries
  - Discovered that full-image OCR fails due to 70+ text regions and false positives
  - Found each field needs specific preprocessing (gradient needs inversion, altitude needs higher threshold)

## Failed Approaches
- **Gymnasticon Issues**:
  - Initial `/opt/gymnasticon` installation had broken UDP functionality
  - Using `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` in UDP commands
  - Missing `-w1` flag for OpenBSD netcat
  - Running without both Power and Cadence connected in Zwift

- **From Previous Checkpoint**:
  - Full-image PaddleOCR scanning - too many false positives, hard to classify
  - One-size-fits-all preprocessing - different fields need different settings
  - Automatic classification without manual validation - error-prone
  - Using same approach for all fields - gradient font requires special handling

## Technical Insights
- **Gymnasticon/Noble on Raspberry Pi**: The Bluetooth stack requires `hciattach` to remain running for BCM43xx chips
- **UDP with OpenBSD netcat**: Must use `-w1` flag and explicit IP `127.0.0.1` for reliable delivery
- **Zwift Connection**: Both Power AND Cadence must be connected, connection order sometimes matters
- **Protocol Reliability**: Bluetooth vs ANT+ success varies day-to-day, no consistent pattern

## Commits
