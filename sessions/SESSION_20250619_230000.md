Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done

### Comprehensive Zwift Racing Documentation Research

Started with user's request to research real-world road racing tactics and how they apply to Zwift racing, specifically for 1-2 hour races.

### Academic Research Collection

- Found peer-reviewed studies on cycling aerodynamics:
  - CFD studies showing 90-95% drag reduction in 121-rider pelotons
  - Swiss Side wind tunnel data: 65% drag reduction at 10cm
  - Olds' research: Optimal breakaway size 5-7 riders
  - Martin et al. (1998) power equation validation

- Discovered Zwift-specific physics findings:
  - 25-35% draft savings (binary model)
  - No confirmed 8-rider draft limit
  - "Blob effect" - groups travel 2-3 km/h faster than physics predicts
  - Zwift described as "crit racing at 3x speed"

### Critical Tactical Differences Discovered

- **Attack timing completely different**:
  - Climbs: Attack mid-climb, not at base ("The hard ramp usually happens in the middle")
  - Descents: Attack before crest, not during descent
  - Gradients halved on descents (8% feels like 4%)

- **Binary draft model**:
  - You're either in (25-35% benefit) or out (0%)
  - No gradual positioning like real world
  - "Sticky draft" phenomenon unique to Zwift

### Documentation Creation - 11 New/Updated Files

Created comprehensive racing guides:
1. **BLOB_SIZE_SCIENCE.md** - Academic research vs Zwift reality
2. **BLOB_DYNAMICS_MASTERY.md** - Complete pack racing guide
3. **BREAKAWAY_SIZE_STRATEGY.md** - When to attack, group sizes
4. **GROUP_SIZE_MATRIX.md** - Quick reference tables
5. **REAL_VS_VIRTUAL_PHYSICS.md** - Physics comparison
6. **ZWIFT_VS_ROAD_RACING.md** - Tactical differences
7. **RACING_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md** - One-page summary
8. **PELOTON_AERODYNAMICS.md** - Academic CFD research

Updated existing guides:
- **DRAFT_STRATEGIES.md** - Added verified percentages, binary model
- **ROUTE_TACTICS.md** - Added attack timing differences
- **for-racers/README.md** - Added links to new guides

### Cross-Reference Implementation

Added comprehensive cross-references to all documents ensuring proper navigation between related content. Each document now has "See Also" or "Related Guides" sections.

## Failed Approaches

- Initial attempts to fetch Zwift Insider pages returned CSS/JS instead of content
- Had to rely on search results and summaries rather than direct page content
- Some sources mentioned "8-rider draft limit" but couldn't find official documentation

## Commits

No commits made during this session - all work was documentation creation and research.

## Technical Insights

1. **Zwift's Binary Draft Model**: Unlike real-world gradual draft falloff, Zwift uses binary on/off draft, making positioning even more critical.

2. **Attack Timing Reversal**: Real-world climb attacks happen at base; Zwift attacks work better mid-climb where gradient is steepest.

3. **Blob Dynamics**: Large groups (20+) in Zwift travel faster than physics would predict due to "churn effect" - continuous rotation at front.

4. **PowerUp Layer**: Adds tactical element absent in real racing - "rare that a sprint is won without aero boost".

5. **Optimal Group Sizes**: Real world 5-7 riders optimal; Zwift 3-5 riders due to better coordination and less churn.
