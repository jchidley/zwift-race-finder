# Session Checkpoint - Mutation Testing Restart

**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Time**: 14:38
**Context**: Restarted mutation testing with optimized configuration

## Session Summary

Successfully optimized and restarted mutation testing after initial system overload.

## Key Changes

### 1. Mutation Testing Scripts Enhanced
- Updated `run_mutation_testing.sh` to:
  - Auto-detect CPU cores with `nproc`
  - Cap at 8 threads max (safer limit)
  - Archive previous runs with timestamps
  - Use `-o .` to avoid nested directory issues

- Updated `check_mutation_progress.sh` to:
  - Parse actual log format (STATUS lines)
  - Show recent activity
  - Handle counting properly without syntax errors

### 2. System Performance Resolution
**Initial Problem** (12 threads):
- Load average: 26.05 (on 12-core system)
- Memory: 5.3GB used + 1.2GB swap
- Progress: Only 2 mutants in 14 minutes
- System thrashing and unresponsive

**After Restart** (8 threads):
- Load average: 10.64 and dropping
- Memory: 922MB used + 527MB swap
- CPU: 83.3% idle
- System responsive and stable

### 3. Mutation Testing Status
- **Total mutants**: 968
- **Baseline completed**: 72.5s build + 75.3s test
- **Running with**: 8 parallel threads
- **Process ID**: 8288
- **Previous run**: Archived to `mutants.out-backup-20250106_143643/`

## Current State

### Repository Status
- Branch: main
- All 89 tests passing
- Zero compilation warnings
- Refactoring Phase 1 complete (4 modules extracted)

### Active Processes
- Mutation testing running in background (PID 8288)
- Using sustainable resource levels
- Expected completion: 1-2 hours

### Files Modified
1. `run_mutation_testing.sh` - Auto-detects cores, caps at 8 threads
2. `check_mutation_progress.sh` - Fixed parsing and counting

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor mutation testing**:
   ```bash
   ./check_mutation_progress.sh
   tail -f mutation_logs/full_run.log
   ```

2. **Once complete, analyze results**:
   ```bash
   grep "Survived" mutants.out/outcomes.json
   cargo mutants --list-missed
   ```

3. **Add tests for survived mutants** to improve coverage

4. **Plan Phase 2 refactoring** based on mutation results

## Key Learnings

1. **Thread limits matter**: 12 threads overwhelmed the system despite having 12 cores
2. **cargo-mutants warning was accurate**: "values <= 8 are usually safe"
3. **Background execution works well**: nohup allows long-running tests
4. **Script improvements**: Auto-detection and archiving prevent issues

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Check progress
./check_mutation_progress.sh

# Watch live log
tail -f mutation_logs/full_run.log

# Check system load
top

# Stop if needed
kill 8288

# Find survived mutants when done
grep -l "Survived" mutants.out/*/outcome.json
```

**Session Status**: Mutation testing running smoothly
**System Health**: Good (sustainable load)
**Next Action**: Wait for completion, then analyze results
