# Session: Mechanical Refactoring Phase 1 Complete

Date: 2025-01-06
Duration: ~30 minutes

## Session Summary

Successfully completed Phase 1 of the mechanical refactoring, extracting 4 safe modules from main.rs.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Fixed failing test**
   - `test_racing_score_event_filtering` was using wrong route_id (9 instead of 3379779247)
   - Test now passes with correct Three Village Loop route data

2. **Cleaned up compilation warnings**
   - Removed unused imports (`DateTime` in cache.rs, `std::fs` in main.rs)
   - All tests passing without warnings

3. **Created mutation testing infrastructure**
   - `run_mutation_testing.sh` - Runs mutation testing on modules in background
   - `check_mutation_progress.sh` - Monitors progress
   - Mutation testing now running to validate test coverage

### Code Metrics
- main.rs: Reduced from 4,580 to 3,688 lines (further reduction from previous 3,689)
- Modules extracted: 4 (models, category, parsing, cache)
- Test status: All 89 tests passing

### Next Refactoring Opportunities (Require Human Review)

Based on analysis of the remaining code in main.rs, here are potential refactoring candidates:

#### 1. **API/HTTP Module** (~200 lines)
- Functions: `fetch_zwift_events`, `fetch_events_from_api`
- Clear boundaries, minimal dependencies
- Risk: Medium - HTTP error handling needs careful review

#### 2. **Configuration Module Enhancement** (~150 lines)
- Functions: `load_config`, CLI args handling
- Already has config.rs, could move more logic there
- Risk: Low - mostly data structures and parsing

#### 3. **Display/Output Module** (~400 lines)
- Functions: `display_events`, `prepare_event_row`, `format_duration`, etc.
- Well-defined display logic
- Risk: Low - pure formatting functions

#### 4. **Statistics Module** (~100 lines)
- Struct: `FilterStats` and related functions
- Functions: `count_events_by_type`, `display_filter_stats`
- Risk: Low - simple data aggregation

#### 5. **Duration Estimation Module** (~500 lines) - COMPLEX
- Functions: `estimate_duration_*` family
- Core business logic with many interdependencies
- Risk: High - requires careful human review

#### 6. **Event Filtering Module** (~300 lines) - COMPLEX  
- Function: `filter_events` and helpers
- Core business logic, mutation-heavy
- Risk: High - modifies data, complex conditions

### Why Human Review is Essential

The remaining modules contain:
- Complex business logic that could be subtly altered
- Mutable state and data transformations
- Error handling patterns that affect user experience
- Performance-critical code paths

### Recommendations

1. **Wait for mutation testing results** to identify gaps in test coverage
2. **Add behavioral tests** for complex functions before refactoring
3. **Consider incremental extraction** - start with low-risk modules
4. **Use the mechanical refactoring process** from REFACTORING_RULES.md
5. **Review each PR carefully** - even mechanical changes need validation

### Mutation Testing

Currently running mutation testing on:
- src/models.rs
- src/category.rs  
- src/parsing.rs
- src/cache.rs

Results will help identify:
- Functions with weak test coverage
- Opportunities to improve test quality
- Code that might be safely removed

### Session Conclusion

Phase 1 mechanical refactoring complete. The codebase is now more modular with clear separation of:
- Data models
- Category logic
- Text parsing utilities
- Caching functionality

Next steps require human judgment to:
1. Review mutation testing results
2. Decide which modules to extract next
3. Add tests for complex business logic
4. Ensure behavioral preservation
