# Test Coverage Improvement Session

## Date: 2025-01-06

### Objective
Improve test coverage for mutation testing by adding comprehensive unit tests to modules with low coverage.

### Initial State
- Mutation testing was timing out
- Several modules had low test coverage
- Missed mutations identified in:
  - `database.rs`: Functions returning default values
  - `route_discovery.rs`: Match guards and OR operators
  - `event_filtering.rs`: New module with minimal tests

### Actions Taken

1. **Added comprehensive tests for event_filtering module**
   - Created 18 unit tests covering all filter functions
   - Tests for FilterStats calculations
   - Edge cases for each filter type (sport, time, event type, tags, duration)
   - Coverage improved from 41% to 82%

2. **Enhanced route_discovery module tests**
   - Added tests for `format_world_name` function
   - Added edge case tests for world detection
   - Added tests for route parsing edge cases
   - Coverage improved from 31% to 50%

3. **Test Structure Improvements**
   - Used parameterized test cases where appropriate
   - Covered both positive and negative test scenarios
   - Added edge case testing (empty inputs, invalid data)
   - Ensured mutation-resistant tests (checking exact values, not just success/failure)

### Coverage Results

| Module | Initial Coverage | Final Coverage | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| event_filtering.rs | 41.03% | 82.05% | +41.02% |
| route_discovery.rs | 31.16% | 50.12% | +18.96% |
| Overall Total | 43.50% | 54.53% | +11.03% |

### Key Testing Patterns Applied

1. **Boundary Testing**: Testing with zero, negative, and maximum values
2. **Edge Cases**: Empty collections, None values, special characters
3. **Mutation Resistance**: Tests that verify exact behavior, not just "it works"
4. **State Verification**: Checking that filters actually remove the correct items

### Missed Mutations Addressed

1. **Filter predicates**: Added tests to ensure != vs == operators are tested
2. **OR operators**: Tests that verify both branches of OR conditions
3. **Match guards**: Tests that exercise both true and false guard conditions
4. **Default returns**: Tests that verify functions don't just return defaults

### Next Steps

1. Run full mutation testing suite to verify improvements
2. Address remaining low-coverage modules:
   - main.rs (35% coverage) - needs integration tests
   - database.rs - needs mock database for unit testing
3. Consider adding property-based tests for complex logic
4. Set up CI to maintain minimum coverage threshold

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start with unit tests**: They're faster to write and run than integration tests
2. **Focus on behavior**: Test what the code does, not how it does it
3. **Think like a mutant**: Consider how the code could be broken and test for that
4. **Use test helpers**: Create reusable test data builders to reduce boilerplate
