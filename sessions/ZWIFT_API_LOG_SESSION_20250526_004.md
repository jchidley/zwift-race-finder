## Session: Route Discovery Enhancement with Caching

Started with functional route discovery but slow performance for bulk operations.

### Key Accomplishments
- Implemented thread-safe in-memory caching using Arc<Mutex<HashMap>>
- Added 500ms rate limiting between HTTP requests for respectful scraping
- Optimized world search from 10 to 5 most common worlds
- Cleaned up database by removing 20+ already-known routes from unknown_routes table
- Successfully finding races with proper duration estimates (Three Village Loop = 20 min)

### Discoveries
- **Rate Limiting Impact**: Even 500ms delay makes bulk operations slow (185 routes = 8 minutes)
- **Caching Essential**: Without it, duplicate event names trigger repeated failed searches
- **Event Names != Route Names**: Most "unknown routes" are custom event names, not actual routes
- **Clean Architecture Win**: When Google search failed, only needed to modify search function

### Technical Details

#### Caching Implementation
```rust
pub struct RouteDiscovery {
    client: reqwest::Client,
    cache: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, Option<DiscoveredRoute>>>>,
}

// Check cache before making HTTP requests
if let Some(cached_result) = cache.get(event_name) {
    if let Some(route) = cached_result {
        return Ok(route.clone());
    } else {
        return Err(anyhow!("Route already searched but not found"));
    }
}

// Cache both successes and failures
cache.insert(event_name.to_string(), Some(route.clone())); // Success
cache.insert(event_name.to_string(), None); // Failure
```

#### Rate Limiting
```rust
// Add respectful delay between requests
tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
```

#### Optimized World Search
```rust
// Reduced from 10 to 5 most common worlds
let worlds = ["watopia", "makuri-islands", "london", "new-york", "france"];
```

### Database Cleanup
- Removed routes that were in both `unknown_routes` and `routes` tables
- Example: Three Village Loop (route_id: 3379779247) was marked unknown but actually known
- SQL: `DELETE FROM unknown_routes WHERE route_id IN (SELECT route_id FROM routes);`

### Next Session Priority
Improve world detection by parsing event names for world hints (e.g., "Makuri May" â†’ makuri-islands)

### Known Issues
1. **Discovery Timeout**: Full discovery of 185 routes takes ~8 minutes
2. **Placeholder Route ID**: Using 9999 for discovered routes - need real ID extraction
3. **World Detection**: Currently brute-forcing worlds - need smarter heuristics

### Lessons Learned
1. Always implement caching for external API calls
2. Rate limiting is critical for being a good web citizen
3. Clean architecture allows easy pivots when external dependencies fail
4. Database hygiene matters - stale data causes confusion
