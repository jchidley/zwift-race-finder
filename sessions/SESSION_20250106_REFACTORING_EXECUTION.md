# Session Log - Mechanical Refactoring Execution

**Date**: 2025-01-06, ~20:00-21:00
**Focus**: Executing mechanical refactoring following REFACTORING_RULES.md

## Session Goal
Execute the mechanical extraction of 4 safe modules from main.rs following REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md exactly.

## Key Accomplishments

Successfully extracted 4 modules using mechanical copy-delete method:

1. **models.rs** (lines 108-251)
   - Extracted: ZwiftEvent, EventSubGroup, UserStats, RouteData, CachedStats
   - Functions: default_sport(), is_racing_score_event()
   - Added `pub` to all items as compiler required

2. **category.rs** (lines ~189-210) 
   - Extracted: get_category_from_score(), get_category_speed()
   - Constants: CAT_A_SPEED, CAT_B_SPEED, CAT_C_SPEED, CAT_D_SPEED
   - Made constants public for test access

3. **parsing.rs** (lines ~102-409)
   - Extracted: DescriptionData struct
   - Functions: parse_description_data(), parse_distance_from_description(), 
     parse_distance_from_name(), parse_lap_count()
   - Removed #[cfg(test)] from parse_lap_count as it's used in non-test code

4. **cache.rs** (lines ~453-601)
   - Extracted: get_cache_file(), load_cached_stats(), save_cached_stats()
   - Uses models from models.rs (UserStats, CachedStats)

## Process Followed

For each module extraction:
1. ✅ Created new branch `refactor-extract-modules`
2. ✅ Ran `cargo test` before starting (found pre-existing failure)
3. ✅ Used `cp src/main.rs src/<module>.rs`
4. ✅ Deleted everything except specified items (mechanical delete only)
5. ✅ Updated src/lib.rs with module declaration
6. ✅ Deleted extracted code from main.rs
7. ✅ Added import to main.rs
8. ✅ Added `pub` only where compiler required
9. ✅ Committed immediately when tests passed

## Behavioral Preservation

- All tests that passed before (47) still pass
- One test `test_racing_score_event_filtering` was already failing on main branch
- No debugging attempted per REFACTORING_RULES.md
- No code modifications except visibility changes

## Code Reduction

- main.rs reduced from ~4,580 lines to 3,689 lines
- ~891 lines moved to separate modules
- Better code organization without changing behavior

## Commits Created

```
cdb90f2 refactor: extract cache module from main.rs
a54eefa refactor: extract parsing module from main.rs
f54355f refactor: extract category module from main.rs
2425e80 refactor: extract models module from main.rs
```

## What Was NOT Done

Per REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md, refused to extract complex modules:
- estimation.rs - Has critical mutations and circular dependencies
- display.rs - 600+ lines with many mutations
- filtering.rs - Core business logic with critical mutations
- commands.rs - Database interactions with side effects

## Key Learning

The mechanical copy-delete method worked perfectly for simple, self-contained modules. No behavioral changes occurred because we made zero logical modifications - only moved code and adjusted visibility.

## Next Steps

1. Push branch and create PR
2. Consider mutation testing on new modular structure
3. Complex modules would require human oversight for extraction
