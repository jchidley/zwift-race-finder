## Session: Batch Discovery Implementation
**Date**: 2025-05-27
**Goal**: Implement batch processing for route discovery to handle 185 unknown routes without timeouts

### Context
- Previous implementation processed all routes sequentially, causing timeouts at ~2 minutes
- 185 unknown routes needed discovery, mostly custom event names
- World detection + caching created 10x performance improvement per route

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Batch Processing Architecture
```rust
// Process routes in manageable chunks
const BATCH_SIZE: usize = 20;
const BATCH_TIMEOUT_MINS: u64 = 2;

// Sort by frequency to prioritize high-value routes
unknown.sort_by(|a, b| b.2.cmp(&a.2));

// Process in batches with progress tracking
for (batch_num, chunk) in unknown.chunks(BATCH_SIZE).enumerate() {
    let batch_start = std::time::Instant::now();
    // Process batch with timeout checks
}
```

#### 2. Key Features Added
- **Prioritization**: Sort routes by frequency (times_seen) before processing
- **Batch Timeouts**: Each batch limited to 2 minutes, saves progress between runs
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows batch number, routes processed, success/failure counts
- **Graceful Interruption**: Detects approaching timeout and saves state
- **Inter-batch Pausing**: 5-second pause between batches to be respectful

#### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Shows frequency count for each route: `[55x] Searching for 'Restart Monday Mash'`
- Real-time progress: `Batch 1 of 10 (20 routes)`
- Clear timeout notifications: `‚è∞ Approaching timeout limit, saving progress...`
- Summary stats: Successfully discovered, failed, skipped, remaining

### Testing Results

#### First Batch Run
```
üì¶ Batch 1 of 10 (20 routes):
üîé [ 55x] Searching for 'Restart Monday Mash' (ID: 1917017591)... ‚ùå Failed
üîé [ 37x] Searching for 'TEAM VTO POWERPUSH' (ID: 2128890027)... ‚ùå Failed
üîé [ 27x] Searching for 'The Bump Sprint Race' (ID: 3366225080)... ‚ùå Failed
...
‚è∞ Approaching timeout limit, saving progress...
Batch 1 complete: 0 found, 15 failed

üìä Discovery Summary:
  ‚úÖ Successfully discovered: 0
  ‚ùå Failed to discover: 15
  ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped (recent attempts): 0
  ‚è≥ Remaining to process: 170
```

### Key Findings
1. **Custom Event Names**: Most high-frequency "unknown routes" are custom event names
   - "Restart Monday Mash" (55x)
   - "TEAM VTO POWERPUSH" (37x)
   - These don't map to actual Zwift route names

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Processing 15 routes in ~90 seconds (6 sec/route with delays)
   - Would need ~19 minutes for all 185 routes without batching
   - Batch approach allows progress across multiple runs

3. **World Detection Working**: 
   - Detected "Watopia" from "Zwift Epic Race - Sacre Bleu"
   - Reduces API calls by checking detected world first

### Next Steps
1. **Manual Mapping Table**: Create mappings for recurring custom events
   - Research actual routes used by these events
   - Build SQL update script for common patterns

2. **Event Description Integration**: 
   - Many custom events likely have route info in descriptions
   - Integrate parse_route_from_description() into discovery

3. **Alternative Data Sources**:
   - Check ZwiftPower event pages for route information
   - Consider community-sourced route mappings

### Code Quality
- No compilation errors
- Proper error handling and progress tracking
- Respects external API rate limits
- Clean separation of concerns

### Lessons Learned
1. **Batch Processing Essential**: Large discovery tasks need chunking
2. **Progress Persistence**: Users appreciate seeing saved progress
3. **Custom Events Common**: Many Zwift events use creative names
4. **Prioritization Matters**: Processing high-frequency events first maximizes value
