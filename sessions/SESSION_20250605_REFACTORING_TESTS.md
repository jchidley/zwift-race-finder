# Session Summary - Test Migration and Duration Module Extraction
Date: 2025-06-05, 19:02 BST

## Overview
This session focused on completing the test migration for previously extracted modules and creating a new duration_estimation module.

## Key Issue Discovered
When initially moving tests from main.rs to event_analysis.rs, I incorrectly created test structs with wrong fields. The EventSubGroup struct was created with fields like `description`, `duration_in_seconds`, and `subgroup_label` that don't exist in the actual struct definition. This was caught when the user questioned why the structure needed to change.

### Root Cause
I attempted to recreate the test from memory rather than copying it exactly, leading to incorrect field names.

### Resolution
- Checked the actual EventSubGroup struct definition in models.rs
- Updated the test to use the correct fields: `id`, `route_id`, `category_enforcement`, `range_access_label`
- Tests now pass without any struct changes

## Test Migrations Completed

### To models.rs:
- `test_is_racing_score_event` - tests the is_racing_score_event() function
- `test_default_sport` - tests the default_sport() function

### To cache.rs:
- `test_get_cache_file` - tests the get_cache_file() function
- `test_load_and_save_cached_stats` - tests cache loading/saving functionality

### To event_analysis.rs:
- `test_count_events_by_type` - tests event counting by type
- `test_find_user_subgroup` - tests finding user's appropriate subgroup

### To formatting.rs:
- `test_format_duration` - tests duration formatting
- `test_format_event_type` - tests event type formatting

### To parsing.rs:
- 5 parsing-related tests for distance parsing from various sources

## New Module Created

### duration_estimation.rs
Extracted pure functions for duration calculation:
- `get_route_difficulty_multiplier_from_elevation()` - calculates difficulty based on elevation
- `get_route_difficulty_multiplier()` - calculates difficulty based on route name
- `estimate_duration_for_category()` - estimates race duration
- `calculate_duration_with_dual_speed()` - advanced duration calculation (for future use)

## Results
- All 91 tests passing (up from 89, added 2 new tests in duration_estimation)
- main.rs further reduced in size
- Better separation of concerns with duration logic in dedicated module
- Tests now live with the code they test

## Lessons Learned
1. Always copy tests exactly when migrating - don't recreate from memory
2. Verify struct definitions before creating test data
3. Mechanical refactoring means preserving exact behavior, including test structure

## Next Steps
- Continue identifying pure functions that can be extracted
- Consider creating a display/UI module for formatting functions
- Look for more database-related functions to consolidate
