# Session Checkpoint 234500
Created: 2025-06-01 23:45:00 UTC
Task: Implement ZwiftHacks-inspired features for event filtering and route tracking
Progress: Added tag filtering, URL parameters, and route completion tracking inspired by ZwiftHacks tools
Next: Consider implementing sync URLs for route completion data

## Work Done
- Reviewed ZwiftHacks tools and documented valuable techniques
- Added proper attribution to README respecting their non-commercial terms
- Implemented event tag filtering with --tags and --exclude-tags
- Discovered 148+ hidden event tags used by Zwift (ranked, zracing, jerseyunlock, etc.)
- Added URL parameter support with --from-url for sharing filter configurations
- Created route completion tracking system with database table
- Implemented --mark-complete, --show-progress, and --new-routes-only commands
- Added completion indicators (âœ“) in event listings
- Created progress visualization with bars for overall and per-world completion

## Failed Approaches
- Initial API endpoint was wrong (missing /upcoming) - fixed in debug script
