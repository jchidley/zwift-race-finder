# Session: Mutation Testing Optimization

**Date**: 2025-06-05
**Time**: 14:30 - 15:30
**Context**: Optimizing mutation testing performance after Phase 1 refactoring

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented multiple optimizations for mutation testing to reduce runtime from estimated 18-24 hours to 10-15 hours.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Performance Optimizations Implemented

**Completed optimizations:**
- ✅ Created custom Cargo profile (`mutants`) with no debug symbols and opt-level=1
- ✅ Configured cargo-mutants to use Nextest runner for faster test execution
- ✅ Set up ramdisk at `/ram` for faster file I/O operations
- ✅ Configured to skip doctests and benchmarks (reducing overhead)
- ✅ Optimized thread count (8 threads on 12-core system)

**Pending optimization:**
- ⏳ Mold linker installation (will provide 20% faster linking)

### 2. Configuration Files Created

**`.cargo/mutants.toml`:**
```toml
# Cargo mutants configuration for optimized performance
profile = "mutants"
test_tool = "nextest"
minimum_test_timeout = 120
additional_cargo_test_args = ["--tests", "--bins", "--examples", "--lib"]
```

**`Cargo.toml` addition:**
```toml
[profile.mutants]
inherits = "test"
debug = "none"
opt-level = 1
```

### 3. Script Enhancements

Updated `run_mutation_testing.sh` with:
- Ramdisk detection and usage
- Nextest detection and configuration
- Better progress reporting
- Archive previous runs with timestamps

### 4. Issues Resolved

- Fixed cargo-mutants configuration syntax errors
- Resolved benchmark compilation issues by excluding them
- Handled RUSTFLAGS mold linker issues (postponed until mold installation)

## Technical Details

### Performance Impact
- **Baseline estimate**: 18-24 hours (unoptimized)
- **Optimized estimate**: 10-15 hours (with current optimizations)
- **Expected with mold**: 8-12 hours (additional 20% improvement)

### Resource Usage
- Initial attempt with 12 threads caused system overload (load average 26)
- Reduced to 8 threads for stability (load average ~10)
- Memory usage reduced from 5.3GB to under 1GB

### Ramdisk Benefits
- Mutation testing now uses `/ram` for temporary files
- Significantly faster file I/O for build artifacts
- Reduces disk wear from intensive compilation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete mold installation** for additional 20% performance gain
2. **Run full mutation testing** once mold is ready
3. **Analyze survived mutants** to identify test coverage gaps
4. **Add tests** for any gaps found by mutation testing
5. **Plan Phase 2 refactoring** based on mutation testing insights

## Key Learnings

1. **cargo-mutants performance is I/O bound** - ramdisk provides significant improvement
2. **Thread count matters** - more isn't always better (8 threads optimal for 12-core system)
3. **Nextest is superior** to standard cargo test for parallel execution
4. **Profile optimization** (no debug symbols) reduces build times substantially
5. **Benchmark compatibility** can be problematic - better to exclude for mutation testing

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Start optimized mutation testing
./run_mutation_testing.sh

# Monitor progress
./check_mutation_progress.sh
tail -f mutation_logs/full_run.log

# Find survived mutants when complete
grep "Survived" mutants.out/outcomes.json
```

**Session Status**: Paused for mold installation
**Mutation Testing**: Ready to run with optimizations
**Next Action**: Run mutation testing after mold installation completes
