# Session: Zwift Integrations Research and Route Data Population
Date: 2025-06-02 UTC

## Summary
Researched Zwift's external app integrations and successfully populated all 264 routes with accurate lead-in distance data from WhatsOnZwift.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Zwift Integrations Research
- Created comprehensive documentation in ZWIFT_INTEGRATIONS_RESEARCH.md
- Explored official integrations:
  - Strava: Activity sync, but no route metadata
  - Garmin Connect: Similar to Strava
  - TrainingPeaks: Training data only
- Discovered WhatsOnZwift has the most accurate route data:
  - Route distances with lead-in
  - Elevation profiles
  - Speed recommendations

### 2. WhatsOnZwift Data Extraction
- Built fetch_whatsonzwift_simple.py scraper
- Successfully extracted lead-in distance for all routes
- Populated database with:
  - Lead-in distances (0.0 to 4.47 km)
  - Route slugs for URL generation
  - Verified data accuracy

### 3. Accuracy Verification
- Maintained 15.9% mean absolute error (below 20% target)
- Duration predictions remain accurate with new data
- Added insights to PROJECT_WISDOM.md about data sources

## Technical Details

### Database Updates
- All 264 routes now have lead_in_distance_km populated
- Route slugs added for WhatsOnZwift URL generation
- No schema changes needed (fields already existed)

### Key Insights Added to PROJECT_WISDOM
- WhatsOnZwift is more accurate than ZwiftHacks for route data
- Lead-in distance varies significantly (0-4.47 km)
- Route slugs enable direct linking to detailed route info

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing additional data sources for further accuracy improvements
- Explore other feature requirements from REQUIREMENTS.md
- Monitor accuracy as more race results are collected
