# Session Log - Refactoring Plan Alignment with REFACTORING_RULES.md

**Date**: 2025-01-06, ~14:00-14:30
**Focus**: Aligning refactoring plans with mechanical copy-delete method

## Session Goal
User requested a single refactoring file that follows REFACTORING_RULES.md, replacing multiple planning documents.

## Key Insight
The original refactoring plans contained "thinking triggers" that would cause AI to modify code:
- "Move functions preserving error handling"
- "Move functions exactly as they are"  
- "If tests fail: debug, try again"

These phrases activate AI's "helpful" mode, leading to code modifications.

## Solution Implemented
Created REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md with purely mechanical language:
- "Copy entire file"
- "DELETE everything EXCEPT [exact list]"
- "USE ONLY DELETE KEY"
- "If ANY test fails: git checkout . && STOP"

## Documentation Changes

### Created
- **REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Single unified execution plan with mechanical steps

### Deleted (redundant)
- REFACTORING_PLAN.md
- REFACTORING_FINAL_PLAN.md  
- REFACTORING_DEPENDENCIES.md
- REFACTORING_ANALYSIS.md

## Safe vs Unsafe Classification

### Safe to Extract (Simple, No Dependencies)
1. models.rs - Data structures only
2. category.rs - Two pure functions
3. parsing.rs - Pure parsing functions
4. cache.rs - Isolated I/O

### Must Refuse (Complex Dependencies)
- estimation.rs - Critical mutations, circular deps
- display.rs - 600+ lines, many mutations
- filtering.rs - Core business logic
- commands.rs - Database interactions

## Key Principle Reinforced
**"Tests failing = You failed, not the tests"**

The tests are the specification. If they fail after refactoring, behavior was changed. The only correct response is immediate revert without debugging.

## Next Steps
Ready to execute mechanical extraction of 4 safe modules following REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md exactly.
