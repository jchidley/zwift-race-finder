Task: Integrate zwift-offline route data into zwift-race-finder
Progress: Successfully created license-compatible integration and imported 3 new routes
Next: Review and fix world mapping issue for imported routes

## Work Done
- Created Python virtual environment setup for zwift-offline using `uv`
- Implemented route export API endpoints in zwift-offline fork
- Built import shell script and Rust client for data extraction
- Successfully imported 3 new routes (France - Macaron, Gravel Mountain, Gravel Mountain Reverse)
- Ran regression tests showing 20.4% MAE (better than documented 23.6%)

## Failed Approaches
- Initial attempt to run zwift-offline on privileged ports (80/443) - Fixed by using ports 8080/8443
- Database file confusion (zwift_routes.db vs races.db) - Resolved by checking actual database path
- Compilation errors in import tool due to incorrect RouteData struct - Fixed by using database::RouteData
