# Session Log: Comprehensive Refactoring Documentation

**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Status**: Documentation successfully created

## Session Summary

Following the failed refactoring attempt documented in SESSION_20250106_REFACTORING_FAILURE.md, created comprehensive documentation to address AI refactoring behavior using Anthropic's prompt engineering best practices.

## Key Activities

### 1. Found Martin Fowler's Exact Definitions
- Searched refactoring.com for authoritative definitions
- Corrected paraphrased quotes to exact wording
- Definition: "A disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior"

### 2. Discovered Full Scope of Refactoring
Initial realization from user: "My request to refactor by moving functions... is just one, and the simplest, kind of refactoring"

Explored Fowler's complete catalog:
- 60+ different refactoring types
- 6 major categories
- Each with unique challenges for AI

### 3. Created Comprehensive Documentation

#### REFACTORING_RULES.md (AI-focused)
Complete rewrite featuring:
- Catalog of Safe Refactoring Mechanics
  - Move Function (mechanical copy-delete)
  - Extract Function (copy exact fragment)
  - Rename (change names ONLY)
  - Extract Variable (assign exactly as-is)
  - Inline Function/Variable (with caution)
  - Change Function Declaration (migration method)
- Universal STOP signals
- Refactoring Decision Tree
- Complex refactorings to avoid
- Recovery protocol

#### REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md (Human-focused)
Comprehensive guide including:
- Full refactoring catalog overview
- Why AI fails at refactoring (improvement bias)
- Real failure examples from our session
- Difficulty ratings for each type
- When to use AI vs human

### 4. Applied Prompt Engineering Techniques
- XML tags for behavioral contracts (`<critical_contract>`, `<mechanics>`, `<stop_signals>`)
- Required response format templates
- Concrete failure examples
- Mechanical processes that remove decision points
- Clear validation checklists

## Key Insights

### 1. Scope Expansion
- Move Function is just one of 60+ refactoring types
- Each type needs its own mechanical process
- Some refactorings are too complex for AI

### 2. AI Failure Modes Vary by Type
- Move Function: Temptation to "clean up"
- Extract Function: Deciding "better" extraction
- Rename: Fixing "related issues"
- Change Declaration: "Improving" the API

### 3. Core Solution Remains
"Remove the opportunity to think, and you remove the opportunity to 'improve'"

### 4. Refactoring Complexity Spectrum
- Easy for AI: Move Function, Extract Variable
- Moderate: Rename, Extract Function
- Hard: Change Function Declaration
- Better for humans: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

## Files Modified

### Created
- REFACTORING_RULES.md (comprehensive rewrite)
- REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md (comprehensive rewrite)
- sessions/SESSION_20250106_REFACTORING_DOCUMENTATION.md (this file)

### Updated
- HANDOFF.md (updated current state)
- docs/PROJECT_WISDOM.md (added two new insights)
- .gitignore (added mutants.out/)

### Removed (intermediate files)
- ANTHROPIC_BUG_REPORT.md
- REFACTORING_PROMPT_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md
- REFACTORING_RULES_CLAUDE.md

## Technical Details

### Prompt Engineering Success
The combination of:
1. Behavioral contracts (XML tags)
2. Mechanical processes (no decisions)
3. STOP signals (thought interruption)
4. Concrete examples (pattern matching)
5. Recovery protocols (prevent fixing forward)

Creates an environment where AI cannot deviate from safe refactoring.

### Martin Fowler's Key Principle
"Each transformation (called a 'refactoring') does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring."

This aligns perfectly with mechanical processes - small, safe, verifiable steps.

## Outcome

Successfully transformed a single-technique document into a comprehensive refactoring guide that:
1. Covers the full scope of refactoring
2. Provides mechanical processes for each type
3. Uses prompt engineering to constrain AI behavior
4. Guides humans on when to use AI assistance
5. Acknowledges limitations honestly

The documentation now serves as both a behavioral contract for AI and an educational resource for humans.
