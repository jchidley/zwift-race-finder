# Session Summary: Documentation Cleanup and Organization
Date: 2025-06-03
Duration: ~30 minutes

## Session Overview
This session focused on cleaning up the project root by organizing documentation into a proper directory structure.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Documentation Organization
- Moved 26 documentation files from root to organized subdirectories
- Created clear structure: development/, research/, guides/, archive/
- Kept only 5 essential files in root (README, REQUIREMENTS, CLAUDE, HANDOFF, todo)
- Added docs/README.md to explain the new structure

### 2. ACCURACY_TIMELINE.md Analysis
- Reviewed the file and determined it contains unique historical data
- Shows progression: 92.8% → 31.2% → 25.1% → 36.9% → 25.7% → 16.1%
- Includes detailed explanations of what changed at each stage
- Decision: Keep the file as valuable development history

### 3. Reference Updates
- Updated all paths in root documentation files
- Fixed references in README.md, CLAUDE.md, and HANDOFF.md
- Ensured all documentation remains accessible

## Technical Details

### Files Moved
- 15 files → docs/development/ (logs, planning, process docs)
- 4 files → docs/research/ (technical analysis)
- 6 files → docs/guides/ (setup and operational guides)
- 4 files → docs/archive/ (historical handoffs)
- 1 file → docs/ (PROJECT_WISDOM.md)

### Git History
- Used proper git move operations (not delete/create)
- Clean commit history with descriptive messages
- Two commits: reorganization + session documentation

## Project State
- **Status**: Production ready with clean documentation structure
- **Code**: No changes to source code
- **Tests**: All passing (no changes)
- **Next Steps**: Ready for deployment or feature development

## Key Takeaways
1. Documentation organization improves project maintainability
2. Historical documentation (like ACCURACY_TIMELINE.md) provides valuable context
3. Keeping root directory minimal makes project more approachable
4. Proper git operations preserve file history

## Handoff Notes
The project is in excellent shape with:
- Clean, organized documentation
- All tests passing
- No compiler warnings
- Production-ready code
- Clear separation between active docs (root) and reference material (docs/)

Next session can focus on deployment preparation or new feature development.
