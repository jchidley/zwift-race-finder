# Session: Attempted Code Reorganization and Revert
Date: 2025-01-06
Duration: ~1 hour

## Summary
Attempted to create a modular version of zwift-race-finder by splitting the monolithic main.rs into separate library modules. However, the reorganization introduced behavioral changes that broke functionality. After attempting to fix the issues, we reverted to the last clean git commit.

## Key Events

1. **Initial Request**: User wanted to compare outputs between the old monolithic version (main_backup.rs) and the new modular version

2. **Comparison Script Created**: Built compare_outputs.sh to systematically test both versions with various command-line arguments

3. **Build Issues Encountered**: 
   - Route discovery module had import conflicts between monolithic and modular versions
   - Missing functions that were added to modular version but not in original

4. **Decision to Revert**: User requested to revert to the most recent git commit rather than continue debugging

5. **Clean Revert Completed**: Successfully reverted all changes, working directory is clean

## Lessons Learned

1. **Code reorganization is complex**: What seems like a simple refactoring (moving code to modules) can introduce subtle behavioral changes
2. **Comparison testing is valuable**: The compare_outputs.sh script would have been useful for validating the reorganization
3. **Git is your friend**: Being able to cleanly revert when things go wrong is invaluable

## Current State
- Working directory clean at commit 2a2944f
- No pending changes
- Original monolithic structure preserved
- Tool remains functional with all recent features (filter clarity, duration format improvements)
