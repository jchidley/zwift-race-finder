# Session: Zwift Live Telemetry Requirements
Date: 2025-01-06
Time: 21:00

## Summary

This session focused on exploring real-time telemetry extraction from Zwift for live race analysis. Key discoveries and outcomes:

### Major Discoveries

1. **Zwift Telemetry Limitations**
   - No real-time data in local logs (only debug info)
   - Network packets encrypted since July 2022
   - FIT files saved every 10 minutes (not real-time)
   - Community packet monitoring tools broken
   - No accessible local database

2. **Video Analysis Justification**
   - Initially questioned if Raspberry Pi + Hailo AI accelerator was overkill
   - Discovered it's actually necessary - no other viable options
   - Screen capture + OCR is the only reliable method for real-time data

3. **Zwift Terms of Service Research**
   - Section 5a(XI) prohibits unauthorized platform interaction
   - Screen capture appears acceptable (like OBS streaming)
   - Network interception/memory reading results in 6-month bans
   - Users must determine their own compliance

### Requirements Added

1. **Technical Constraints** (TC-22.5 through TC-22.9)
   - Documented all discovered Zwift limitations
   
2. **New Tool: zwift-live-telemetry** (Section 21)
   - Separate companion application for real-time race monitoring
   - Local screen capture or remote HDMI capture modes
   - OCR extraction of HUD data (power, speed, HR, position)
   - Live coaching features based on extracted telemetry
   - Detailed compliance guidelines

3. **Hardware Architecture**
   - Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo-8L (26 TOPS) for edge processing
   - USB 3.0 HDMI capture for video input
   - Alternative: x86 mini PC options
   - Performance target: 1080p30 with <50ms latency

### Documentation Updates

1. **REQUIREMENTS.md**
   - Added comprehensive Section 21 for live telemetry tool
   - Updated technical constraints with discoveries
   - Enhanced compliance requirements with ToS research
   - Removed definitive compliance claims

2. **README.md**
   - Added project goals emphasizing AI/LLM learning
   - Updated compliance section - users determine compliance
   - Added techniques to avoid based on community reports
   - Clarified our approach vs user responsibility

## Key Insights

1. **Problem-Solution Fit**: When APIs and logs fail, creative solutions (video analysis) become necessary
2. **Compliance Complexity**: Clear distinction between passive observation vs active interaction
3. **AI Development**: This session demonstrated effective use of AI for requirements gathering and research

## Next Steps

1. Proof of concept for OCR on Zwift screenshots
2. Evaluate screen capture libraries for different platforms
3. Design telemetry data schema for SQLite storage
4. Create basic WebSocket server for live data streaming

## Files Modified
- REQUIREMENTS.md (major additions for live telemetry tool)
- README.md (updated goals and compliance sections)
