# Session: Project Cleanup and Reorganization
Date: 2025-06-03
Time: 10:00 - 10:55 BST

## Session Overview
Cleaned up redundant files and reorganized the project structure for better maintainability. Focused on separating core functionality from development tools while preserving important documentation and session files.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. File Cleanup
- Removed 8 redundant files from root directory:
  - 4 test files (`test_*.rs`) that belonged in src/
  - 2 debug output files (`stage4_debug.txt`, `sample_routes.sql`)
  - Preserved files covered by .gitignore as requested
- Restored reference directories after accidental deletion

### 2. Project Reorganization
Created cleaner directory structure:
```
tools/
├── import/
│   ├── zwiftpower/  # ZwiftPower data import scripts
│   ├── strava/      # Strava integration scripts
│   └── routes/      # Route data import tools
├── debug/           # Debug and analysis scripts
└── utils/           # General utility scripts

sql/
├── migrations/      # Schema updates
├── mappings/        # Route mapping queries
└── analysis/        # Data analysis queries
```

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Rewrote README.md with:
  - Cleaner, more focused content
  - Clear project structure diagram
  - Updated paths reflecting new organization
  - Separation of core usage from development tools

## Important Decisions

### What Was Kept
- All session files (important for AI context)
- All documentation files (provides project history)
- Files covered by .gitignore (debug_event_tags.json, strava_config.json)
- Reference repositories for development

### What Was Removed
- Test files in root that should be in src/
- Debug output files
- Obsolete sample_routes.sql (superseded by full import)

## Technical Details

### Git Operations
- Used `git mv` to preserve history when moving files
- All moves tracked properly in git
- Clean commit structure maintained

### Path Updates
- Scripts use relative paths, so most continue to work
- Database paths remain absolute (~/.local/share/)
- No breaking changes to core functionality

## Next Steps
1. Commit the reorganization with clear message
2. Consider publishing to crates.io with clean structure
3. Update any external documentation/guides with new paths

## Lessons Learned
- Important to preserve context files (sessions, docs) for AI assistants
- Git move operations better than delete/create for history
- Clear separation of core vs development tools improves usability

## Files Modified
- Moved 40+ files into organized subdirectories
- Updated README.md
- Removed 6 truly redundant files
- Preserved all .gitignore'd files as requested
