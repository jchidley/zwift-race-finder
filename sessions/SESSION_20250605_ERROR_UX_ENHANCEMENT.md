# Session: Enhanced Error Messages and User Guidance

**Date**: 2025-06-05
**Time**: 17:30 - 18:00
**Context**: Improving user experience through better error messages while mutation testing runs

## Session Summary

Successfully enhanced error handling throughout the application with user-friendly messages, helpful suggestions, and clear guidance for common failure scenarios.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Created Comprehensive Error Module

**New file: `src/errors.rs`**
- ‚úÖ Structured error types with title, details, and suggestions
- ‚úÖ Pre-defined error scenarios for common failures
- ‚úÖ Consistent formatting with colored output
- ‚úÖ Helper functions for all major error types

### 2. Enhanced API Error Handling

**Improved `fetch_events()` function:**
- ‚úÖ Added timeout (30 seconds) to prevent hanging
- ‚úÖ Specific handling for rate limiting (429 status)
- ‚úÖ Clear messages for connection failures
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of parsing errors
- ‚úÖ User-friendly suggestions for each error type

### 3. Better "No Results" Messages

**Enhanced suggestions based on event type:**
- ‚úÖ Race-specific guidance with common durations
- ‚úÖ Time trial availability notes
- ‚úÖ Group ride duration ranges
- ‚úÖ API limitation warnings for multi-day searches
- ‚úÖ Colored command examples for better visibility

### 4. Improved Configuration Handling

**Better feedback for missing/invalid config:**
- ‚úÖ Warning instead of failure when config missing
- ‚úÖ Continues with defaults gracefully
- ‚úÖ Points users to config.example.toml
- ‚úÖ Tips for personalized results

### 5. Database Error Messages

**Enhanced database connection errors:**
- ‚úÖ Shows exact path that failed
- ‚úÖ Suggests mkdir command to fix
- ‚úÖ Clear instructions for permissions issues

## Error Scenarios Now Handled

1. **API Connection Failures**
   - Network issues
   - Rate limiting
   - Invalid responses
   - API downtime

2. **Configuration Issues**
   - Missing config files
   - Invalid Zwift scores
   - No stats available

3. **Database Problems**
   - Connection failures
   - Missing directories
   - Permission issues

4. **Search Results**
   - No events found
   - Empty API response
   - Event type guidance

## Code Quality Improvements

- All tests passing (45 passed, 0 failed)
- Fixed compilation errors
- Updated test expectations for enhanced messages
- Added proper error propagation

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Clear Problem Identification** - Users immediately understand what went wrong
2. **Actionable Suggestions** - Every error includes steps to fix it
3. **Context-Aware Help** - Different suggestions based on what user was trying to do
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Colored output makes errors and suggestions stand out
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Tool continues with defaults when possible

## Example Error Output

```
