# Session: Documentation Migration Analysis
Date: 2025-06-19 21:55:00

## Summary

Analyzed the documentation structure to plan safe migration from the hybrid state (old locations + new directories) to the clean new structure. Created comprehensive migration plan with risk assessment and specific implementation steps.

## Key Findings

1. **Critical External References**:
   - README.md references 2 docs files that need path updates
   - CLAUDE.md references 1 docs file that needs path update
   - Code files reference docs/screenshots/ (must NOT move)

2. **Safe to Move**: 30+ files in docs/development/ and docs/archive/
3. **Already Correct**: docs/guides/, docs/research/, docs/screenshots/
4. **Duplicates Found**: docs/PROJECT_WISDOM.md (root version exists)

## Deliverables

- Created: `wip-claude/20250619_215500_documentation_migration_analysis.md`
- Identified 4-phase migration plan minimizing disruption
- Listed specific commands for Phase 1 (zero-risk moves)
- Documented files that must stay in place

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 - move internal-only files
2. Update references in README.md and CLAUDE.md
3. Move high-risk files after references updated
4. Clean up empty directories

## Notes

- docs/screenshots/ has hard code dependencies - never move
- Historical files (sessions, wip-claude) should keep old references
- Test documentation links after each phase
