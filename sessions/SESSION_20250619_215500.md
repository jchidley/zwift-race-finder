# Session 20250619_215500
Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done

### Physics Documentation and Source Verification
- Found cycling power equations in ZWIFT_API_LOG_SESSION_20250525_001.md
- Researched and verified sources for Zwift physics values:
  - CdA formula (A = 0.0276·h^0.725·m^0.425) is community reverse-engineered, not official
  - Based on Du Bois Body Surface Area formula with modified coefficient
  - Corrected rolling resistance values (Gravel = 0.018, not 0.008)
- Updated /docs/development/plan.md with accurate source attributions
- Created comprehensive /docs/research/ZWIFT_PHYSICS_EQUATIONS.md documenting:
  - Martin et al. (1998) power equation
  - Community-discovered values vs official sources
  - Empirical testing approach
  - Fairness implications

### Zwift Terms of Service Research
- Researched Zwift's requirements for using real height/weight in races
- Found no explicit ToS requirement but strong community enforcement
- Documented findings in /wip-claude/20250619_204523_zwift_height_weight_requirements_research.md

### Documentation Reorganization
- Created comprehensive documentation migration plan with new structure:
  - /for-racers/ - Racing optimization guides
  - /for-developers/ - Technical documentation
  - /reference/ - Core algorithms and concepts
  - /project-history/ - Development journey
- Created navigation READMEs for each section
- Wrote initial racing guides (marked as drafts):
  - POWER_OPTIMIZATION.md - Power as the only controllable variable
  - DRAFT_STRATEGIES.md - Maximizing 24-33% power savings
  - ROUTE_TACTICS.md - Route-specific power distribution
  - ZWIFT_AS_GAME.md - Understanding game mechanics
  - CATEGORY_RACING.md - Optimizing for your division

### Accuracy Update and Draft Modeling Investigation
- Updated README.md accuracy from 16.1% → 20.4% (current regression test result)
- Investigated whether prediction model accounts for draft benefits:
  - Found category speeds (30.9 km/h for Cat D) already include draft from 151 real races
  - Discovered dual-speed model exists in code but isn't used
  - Added note to PROJECT_WISDOM.md about modeling simplification
- Confirmed current approach meets main objective: time-based race selection

## Failed Approaches
- Initial attempt to change accuracy target from <20% to <30% (user corrected this)
- Multiple shell escaping issues when querying SQLite database
