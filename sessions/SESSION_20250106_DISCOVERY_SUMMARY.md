# Code Coverage Discovery Session Summary
**Date**: January 6, 2025
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Focus**: Using test quality to evaluate code necessity

## Key Insight Applied
"Low coverage simply indicates missing tests, not bad code. The key is driving to 100% and inspecting test quality. Poor test quality could indicate poor testing OR poor code." - Jack

## Methodology
1. Identify uncovered functions
2. Write tests for them
3. Evaluate test quality (natural vs contrived)
4. Use quality assessment to decide keep/refactor/remove

## Functions Tested and Results

### All Tests Were Natural ✓
1. **parse_lap_count()** - Extracts lap count from event names
   - Natural tests, discovered case sensitivity limitation
   - KEEP: Essential for multi-lap races

2. **parse_distance_from_name()** - Extracts distance with unit conversion
   - Natural tests, miles→km conversion working correctly
   - KEEP: Core functionality

3. **find_user_subgroup()** - Maps Zwift Score to category
   - Natural tests, revealed code duplication opportunity
   - KEEP: Essential for filtering

4. **get_route_difficulty_multiplier_from_elevation()** - Physics-based difficulty
   - Natural tests with realistic gradients
   - KEEP: Well-calibrated model

5. **get_route_difficulty_multiplier()** - Name-based difficulty fallback
   - Mostly natural, revealed actual vs expected behavior
   - KEEP: Useful fallback

## Coverage Improvement
- main.rs: 36.71% → 40.01% (+3.3%)
- Overall: 42.94% → 44.91% (+2%)

## Key Findings

### 1. Test Quality Pattern
All functions tested had natural, easy-to-write tests. This suggests:
- The uncovered code serves real purposes
- No "dead code" found in the functions tested
- The codebase is generally well-designed

### 2. Discoveries Through Testing
- `parse_lap_count` only handles "Laps" and "laps", not "LAPS"
- Route name matching is simpler than expected
- Category determination logic is duplicated in 3 places

### 3. Refactoring Opportunities
- Extract `get_category_from_score(score: u32) -> &'static str`
- Would eliminate code duplication
- Would make category boundaries testable in one place

## Conclusion
The test-driven discovery approach is working well. Natural tests indicate good code. The process is also revealing:
1. Actual behavior vs assumptions
2. Refactoring opportunities
3. Documentation needs

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing more complex functions
2. Focus on error handling paths
3. Test debug/development features
4. Consider the refactoring opportunities found
