# Session 20250602_233500
Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done
1. Implemented lead-in distance handling (FR-2.1.6)
   - Added 6 new database columns for different lead-in distances (race, free ride, meetups)
   - Updated RouteData struct in both database.rs and main.rs
   - Modified duration calculations to include lead-in distance
   - Display lead-in distance in race output (e.g., "Lead-in: 0.2 km")

2. Added route slug support (DR-11.6) for external URL integration
   - Store route slugs in database for URL generation
   - Generate WhatsOnZwift URLs automatically for known routes
   - Display as "Route Info: https://whatsonzwift.com/world/{world}/route/{slug}"

3. Imported zwift-data route database
   - Created import_zwift_data_routes.py script
   - Successfully imported 264 routes with accurate lead-in data
   - 250 new routes added, 14 existing routes updated
   - Lead-in distances vary significantly (0.2 km to 5.7 km)

## Technical Insights
1. **Lead-in Distance Varies by Event Type**: zwift-data maintains separate lead-in distances for races, free rides, and meetups. This explains duration prediction errors.

2. **Route Slug Pattern**: WhatsOnZwift URLs follow pattern `/world/{world-slug}/route/{route-slug}` where world slugs are lowercase with hyphens.

3. **Database Schema Evolution**: Adding columns to existing tables requires updating all database access code - get_route, add_route, seed_initial_data, and tests.

4. **TypeScript Array Parsing**: zwift-data stores routes as nested arrays in TypeScript. Pattern: `[route_id, name, slug, world, eventOnly, distance, elevation, leadIn, leadInElev, ...]`

## Failed Approaches
1. Initial regex for parsing routes.ts failed - needed to account for wrapping parentheses in `export const routes = ([ ... ])`

2. Test database creation failed after schema change - seed_initial_data was inserting without new columns

## Commits
```
f9a53b1 feat: implement lead-in distance tracking and WhatsOnZwift URL generation
4fe331d fix: update test code to match recent feature additions
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix failing database tests (schema mismatch in test creation)
2. Run regression tests to verify accuracy improvements with lead-in
3. Consider implementing route-specific physics (FR-2.1.7)
