# Session Log: Zwift Race Finder
Date: 2025-01-06
Duration: ~30 minutes

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive description parsing for Zwift events to extract distance, elevation, and lap information from event descriptions. This addresses the user's observation that the companion app shows this data, which comes from the description field rather than API fields.

## Key Accomplishments
- Created `parse_description_data()` function that extracts distance, elevation, and laps from descriptions
- Enhanced event display with "From description:" line showing parsed data
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all parsing patterns

## Technical Insights
- Zwift API returns 0.0 for distance in Racing Score events, but includes the data in description text
- Multiple patterns exist: "Distance: X km", "Elevation: Y m", "3 laps", with both metric and imperial units
- Description parsing complements existing route database lookups for more complete race information

## Challenges Encountered
- DNS connectivity issues prevented testing with live API data
- Need to verify how descriptions appear in real events

## Files Modified
- src/main.rs (added parsing functions and enhanced display)
- HANDOFF.md (updated with completion status)
- src/bin/analyze_descriptions.rs (created for pattern analysis)

## Next Session Priority
Test the description parsing with live API data to verify it works correctly with real events and refine patterns if needed.
