# Session 20250106_235200
Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done
### From Checkpoint 232800 (23:28:00 UTC)
- Identified that "Zwift Epic Race - Sacre Bleu" was filtered out due to unknown route ID 136140280
- Discovered route is "Sacre Bleu" in France (71.2 km, 396m elevation) via web search
- Added route to database, event now appears in results
- Added requirements FER-19.9.1-6 for enhanced route name extraction from event titles and descriptions
- Committed requirements update to git

### From Checkpoint 234500 (23:45:00 UTC)
- Reviewed ZwiftHacks tools and documented valuable techniques
- Added proper attribution to README respecting their non-commercial terms
- Implemented event tag filtering with --tags and --exclude-tags
- Discovered 148+ hidden event tags used by Zwift (ranked, zracing, jerseyunlock, etc.)
- Added URL parameter support with --from-url for sharing filter configurations
- Created route completion tracking system with database table
- Implemented --mark-complete, --show-progress, and --new-routes-only commands
- Added completion indicators (âœ“) in event listings
- Created progress visualization with bars for overall and per-world completion

### Since Last Checkpoint
- Added three key insights to PROJECT_WISDOM.md:
  - Hidden Event Tags Discovery pattern
  - URL Parameter Pattern for CLI Tools
  - Route Completion Tracking Without User Accounts
- Updated tool permissions for WebSearch(*)

## Failed Approaches
- Initial API endpoint was wrong (missing /upcoming) - fixed in debug script

## Commits
a931e29 feat: add event tag filtering and URL parameter support inspired by ZwiftHacks
b8b5e82 docs: add requirements for route name extraction from event titles and descriptions

## Technical Insights
1. **Hidden Event Tags Discovery**: Zwift API includes 148+ undocumented tags in the tags field, enabling powerful filtering for competitive races ("ranked") or series-specific events ("zracing")
2. **URL Parameter Pattern**: Implementing --from-url with query string parsing enables easy sharing of complex filter configurations without config files
3. **Privacy-First Progress Tracking**: Local SQLite storage with optional sync URLs provides gamification without requiring user accounts or personal data

## Next Session Notes
- Uncommitted changes exist in: HANDOFF.md, PROJECT_WISDOM.md, src/database.rs, src/main.rs
- New files created: ROUTE_TRACKING_IDEAS.md, sessions/SESSION_CHECKPOINT_234500.md
- Consider implementing Phase 2 of route tracking: sync URLs for sharing progress across devices
- Route name extraction requirements (FER-19.9) still pending implementation
