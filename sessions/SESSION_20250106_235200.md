# Session: Requirements Expansion - Table Output and Advanced Features
Date: 2025-01-06 23:52:00 UTC

## Summary
This session focused on expanding the Zwift Race Finder requirements with new features including table-based output formatting, GoldenCheetah-inspired performance modeling, race simulation capabilities, and video analysis for model validation.

## Key Additions to Requirements

### 1. Table Output Format (FR-4.2.5, FR-4.2.6, FR-4.2.7)
- Default to compact table: Event Name | Time | Distance | Duration | Route Info (âœ“)
- Show only user's selected category (not all categories)
- Support --verbose flag for detailed multi-line output
- Include total distance with lead-in in table view

### 2. GoldenCheetah Integration Research (FER-19.16, FER-19.17)
- **Critical Discovery**: GPL v3 license prevents direct integration
- Must reimplement concepts from scratch using published papers
- Use GoldenCheetah output for validation only
- Focus on:
  - Critical Power (CP) and W' balance models
  - TSS/CTL/ATL metrics (from public TrainingPeaks formulas)
  - Power-duration curve fitting
  - Race readiness assessment

### 3. Race Simulation Requirements (FER-20.8, FER-20.9, FER-20.10, FER-20.11, FER-20.12)

#### Offline/Online Simulation (FER-20.8, FER-20.9)
- Monte Carlo simulations with varying field sizes
- Model draft dynamics: larger field = more consistent draft
- Generate race plans with:
  - Draft vs non-draft power targets
  - Critical sections identification
  - Contingency strategies
  - Course-specific draft effectiveness

#### Video Analysis (FER-20.10)
- Use OBS Studio to record races with HUD data
- Extract position, power, draft metrics
- Build library of race scenarios
- Validate pack dynamics models

#### Live Data Extraction (FER-20.11)
- AI-based HUD data extraction from video stream
- Architecture options:
  - Host-based with GPU acceleration
  - Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo-8L AI accelerator
- Real-time telemetry pipeline
- Post-race analysis capabilities

#### Open Source Models Research (FER-20.12)
- Find cycling simulators with MIT/Apache/BSD licenses
- Avoid GPL for direct integration
- Focus on:
  - Peloton dynamics models
  - Agent-based simulations
  - CFD draft calculations
  - Validated physics equations

## Technical Insights

### Pack Dynamics
- Confirmed: Draft dynamics are key to accurate predictions
- Larger fields provide more consistent draft opportunities
- Need to model probability of maintaining pack position

### Licensing Considerations
- GPL v3 (GoldenCheetah) incompatible with MIT/Apache
- Must use clean-room implementation approach
- Can use tools for validation, not code integration

### Video Analysis Rationale
- Fills gap in telemetry data (Zwift provides no real-time data)
- Enables validation of dual-speed model
- Provides ground truth for pack position vs power

## Todo List Status
Created comprehensive todo list for table output implementation:
1. Add --verbose flag to Args struct
2. Create table formatter
3. Refactor print_event() for dual modes
4. Calculate total distance with lead-in
5. Add route info indicator
6. Test with various event types

## Next Steps
1. Implement table output format for better UX
2. Research open-source simulation models on GitHub
3. Design proof-of-concept for video analysis
4. Study published papers on Critical Power models

## Files Modified
- REQUIREMENTS.md: Added FR-4.2.5-7, FER-19.16-17, FER-20.8-12
- Created this session file

## Key Decisions
- Table output as default, verbose as option
- No direct GPL code integration
- Video analysis justified by lack of API telemetry
- Focus on compatible open-source models
