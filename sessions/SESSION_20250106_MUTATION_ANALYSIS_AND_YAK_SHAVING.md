# Session: Mutation Analysis and Yak Shaving Concept
Date: 2025-01-06
Duration: ~1 hour

## Summary
Continued from previous session's test reorganization work. Analyzed mutation testing results showing 649 missed mutations and developed understanding of mutation testing interpretation. Created comprehensive documentation mapping old function locations to current ones after refactoring. Added "yak shaving" concept to PROJECT_WISDOM.md for systematic technical debt reduction.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Database Test Migration
- Moved `test_database_route_validation` from main.rs to database.rs where it belongs
- Test validates all routes have reasonable distance, elevation, and surface types

### 2. Mutation Testing Analysis
- User reported 649 missed mutations from cargo-mutants run
- Read mutants.rs documentation to understand that:
  - Missed mutations don't always indicate problems
  - Goal is NOT 100% mutation coverage
  - Focus on business-critical paths
- Created mapping of functions from old locations to new ones after refactoring

### 3. Function Location Mapping
Created comprehensive documentation showing where functions moved during refactoring:
- Many functions moved from main.rs to specialized modules
- event_display.rs gained display-related functions
- event_filtering.rs got filtering logic
- duration_estimation.rs received estimation functions

### 4. Targeted Test Writing
Added tests for critical mutations:
- `test_display_filter_stats_empty_case` - tests == vs != mutation
- `test_prepare_event_row_multi_lap_calculation` - tests * vs + mutation  
- `test_display_distance_based_duration_conversion` - tests / vs % mutation
- `test_analyze_event_descriptions_counter` - tests += vs -= mutation

### 5. Yak Shaving Concept Added to PROJECT_WISDOM.md
Added comprehensive section on systematic technical debt reduction:
- Regular automated cleanup sessions
- Git workflow: Create branch at start, commit/push at end
- Process: Format → Mutation test → Map functions → Fill gaps → Refactor
- Focus on idiomatic code that LLMs understand
- Tool chain includes rustfmt, cargo-mutants, clippy, etc.

## Key Insights

### Mutation Testing Understanding
- 649 missed mutations is not necessarily bad
- Many are in display/logging code that doesn't need unit tests
- Focus should be on critical business logic
- Integration tests often better than forcing unit tests with mocks

### Technical Debt with LLMs
- LLMs accumulate technical debt faster than humans
- Regular "yak shaving" sessions help maintain code quality
- Automated tools provide objective feedback
- Well-tested, idiomatic code constrains LLM modifications

### Git Workflow for Yak Shaving
- Start: Create branch (yak-YYYYMMDD or technical-debt-YYYYMMDD)
- Work: Apply systematic improvements
- End: Commit, push, create PR for review

## Files Modified
- src/database.rs - Added test from main.rs
- src/event_display.rs - Added mutation-catching tests
- src/main.rs - Added counter arithmetic test
- docs/PROJECT_WISDOM.md - Added yak shaving section with git workflow

## Next Steps
- Regular yak shaving sessions to reduce technical debt
- Continue monitoring mutation testing results
- Focus testing efforts on business-critical paths
- Use automated tools to guide improvement priorities

## Session Metrics
- Tests added: 5
- Documentation created: 1 major section in PROJECT_WISDOM.md
- Mutation analysis completed: Mapped 649 mutations to current code structure
- Code quality: All new tests are "natural" (not contrived)
