# ZWIFT API LOG - Session 2025-05-27-004

## Session: Multi-Lap Detection Production Testing
Date: 2025-05-27
Duration: ~45 minutes
Goal: Verify multi-lap detection works with live API data

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Enhanced Pattern Matching Implementation**:
   - Modified `get_multi_lap_info()` in database.rs to use two-stage SQL lookup
   - First tries exact match: `WHERE event_name_pattern = ?1`
   - Falls back to pattern match: `WHERE ?1 LIKE '%' || event_name_pattern || '%'`
   - Enables flexible matching where event names have variants

2. **Production Testing Results**:
   - Tested with live Zwift API data using `cargo run -- -d 30 -t 30`
   - Found 34 matching events in 30-minute range
   - Zwift Crit Racing Club events correctly identified as multi-lap
   - Display format working: "18.0 km (6 laps of 3.0 km)"
   - Duration estimates fixed: 38 minutes instead of 6 minutes (533% improvement!)

3. **Database Updates**:
   ```sql
   -- Added Zwift Crit Racing Club as 6-lap event
   INSERT OR REPLACE INTO multi_lap_events VALUES 
   ('Zwift Crit Racing Club', 3765339356, 6, '6 laps of Glasgow Crit Circuit');
   ```

### Discoveries

1. **Pattern Matching Critical**: Event names vary significantly in the API. "3R Racing" might appear as "3R Racing - Volcano Flat" or "3R Racing Series". Pattern matching handles all variants with one database entry.

2. **Team DRAFT Variance**: Team DRAFT Monday Race (2 laps Castle to Castle) is different from Team DRAFT Tuesday Race (single lap Three Village Loop). Day-specific patterns matter.

3. **Criterium Race Patterns**: Many crit races are multi-lap on short circuits. Without proper detection, they show absurdly short durations (6 minutes for 30+ minute races).

### Technical Details

**Code Changes**:
```rust
// In database.rs - get_multi_lap_info()
pub fn get_multi_lap_info(&self, event_name: &str) -> Result<Option<u32>> {
    // Try exact match first
    let result = self.conn.query_row(
        "SELECT lap_count FROM multi_lap_events WHERE event_name_pattern = ?1",
        params![event_name],
        |row| row.get(0)
    ).optional()?;
    
    if result.is_some() {
        return Ok(result);
    }
    
    // Try pattern match - check if event name contains the pattern
    let result = self.conn.query_row(
        "SELECT lap_count FROM multi_lap_events 
         WHERE ?1 LIKE '%' || event_name_pattern || '%'
         LIMIT 1",
        params![event_name],
        |row| row.get(0)
    ).optional()?;
    
    Ok(result)
}
```

**Current Multi-Lap Events**:
```
3R Racing|3369744027|3|Generic 3R Racing is 3 laps of Volcano Flat
Team DRAFT Monday Race|3742187716|2|Monday race is 2 laps of Castle to Castle
EVR Winter Series|2143464829|2|EVR Winter Series is 2 laps of Watopia Flat Route
Zwift Crit Racing Club|3765339356|6|6 laps of Glasgow Crit Circuit
```

### Impact on Accuracy

- Individual event improvement: 533% error reduction on criterium races
- Overall accuracy: Expected to improve significantly when regression test run
- User experience: No more confusion about 6-minute "races" that are actually 38 minutes

### Next Session Priority

1. Run regression test to measure overall accuracy improvement
2. Continue adding multi-lap events as discovered
3. Consider parsing lap information from event descriptions for automation
