# Session 20250614_200046
Project: zwift-race-finder

## Work Done

### zwift-offline Integration Investigation
- Investigated why zwift-offline only exports 55 routes (filters for eventOnly='1' routes)
- Created comprehensive documentation of zwift-offline codebase structure
- Fixed world mapping bug where France routes were showing as Scotland
- Built import tools for zwift-race-finder with proper license separation

### Route Data Extraction Research
- Discovered all route data exists in WAD files within Zwift installation
- Found that wad_unpack.exe is required but no longer publicly available
- Researched how Zwift events work: base routes + modifiers (laps/distance/duration)
- Documented that free-ride routes have lead-in + lap distance structure

### Code Cleanup
- Removed experimental extraction scripts that require unavailable tools
- Removed route comparison tools used for investigation
- Cleaned up debug images from OCR testing
- Kept only working integration code and documentation

### Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive ROUTE_DATA_EXTRACTION.md documenting findings
- Updated ZWIFT_OFFLINE_INTEGRATION.md with current limitations
- Updated README.md to reflect actual capabilities (378 routes, zwift-offline provides 55)
- Added proper references to all route data sources

## Failed Approaches

### WAD File Extraction
- Created get_all_routes.py and extract_all_routes_wsl.sh scripts
- Scripts require wad_unpack.exe which is no longer available from referenced repos
- Alternative tools (zwf, zwift-utils) have limitations or unclear documentation

### Route Data Workarounds
- Attempted to merge events.txt and start_lines.txt data
- Abandoned because these files lack distance/elevation data
- User correctly identified this approach as pointless
