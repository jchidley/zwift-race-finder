Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done

### CLAUDE.md Refactoring (Major Achievement)
- **Analyzed overlap** with parent CLAUDE.md files (Global and Tools)
- **Reduced CLAUDE.md** from 634 lines to 150 lines (76% reduction)
- **Created 6 new documentation files**:
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and data flow
  - `docs/ALGORITHMS.md` - Duration estimation logic and pack dynamics
  - `docs/ZWIFT_DOMAIN.md` - Racing concepts and terminology
  - `docs/development/DATABASE.md` - Schema, backup, and management
  - `docs/guides/DATA_IMPORT.md` - ZwiftPower and Strava import workflows
  - `docs/development/HISTORICAL_DISCOVERIES.md` - Evolution insights and API discoveries

### Documentation Analysis
- **Identified 8 categories of universal insights** that should flow back to parent docs:
  1. Testing evolution (OCR 0% story)
  2. Technical debt management with LLMs
  3. Documentation as parallel processing
  4. Hierarchical log management
  5. API discovery techniques
  6. Deterministic tools principle
  7. Language selection for LLMs
  8. Empirical development approach

- **Created reverse update plan** for parent CLAUDE.md files
- **Preserved critical OCR 0% lesson** prominently in project CLAUDE.md

### Key Discoveries
- LLMs accumulate technical debt faster than human developers
- Documentation enables human-AI parallel workflow
- Pedantic languages (Rust, TypeScript) help LLMs through compiler feedback
- Browser DevTools reveal undocumented API behavior quickly
- Yak shaving sessions essential for LLM-generated code maintenance

## Failed Approaches
None - session focused on documentation reorganization which proceeded smoothly.

## Technical Insights

### Documentation as Parallel Processing
**Insight**: Writing comprehensive documents enables humans to read/think while AI implements, creating efficient parallel workflow where both parties work simultaneously rather than sequentially.

### LLM Technical Debt Accumulation
**Insight**: LLMs generate working but poorly organized code at unprecedented rates. Regular "yak shaving" sessions with mutation testing are essential to prevent drift and maintain quality.

### Hierarchical Documentation Strategy
**Insight**: The project CLAUDE.md should focus on domain-specific knowledge and concrete case studies, while referencing parent docs for general standards. This creates clear hierarchy: Global → Tools → Project-specific.
