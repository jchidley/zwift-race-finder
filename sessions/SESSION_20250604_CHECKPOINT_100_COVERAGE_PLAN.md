# Session Checkpoint - 100% Function Coverage Planning
**Date**: June 4, 2025, 08:50  
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour  
**Focus**: Planning systematic approach to achieve 100% function coverage

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Coverage Analysis
- Identified current state: 41.77% function coverage in main.rs (66/158 functions)
- Found 32 uncovered functions in main.rs that need tests
- Documented overall project coverage: 39.74% (122/307 functions)

### 2. Created Comprehensive Planning Documents
- **FUNCTION_COVERAGE_PLAN_20250604_084639.md**: Detailed plan with:
  - Categorization of all 32 uncovered functions into 7 categories
  - Priority order based on expected test naturalness
  - Timeline and success criteria
  - Decision framework for evaluating test quality
  
- **SESSION_20250604_COVERAGE_BASELINE.md**: Current state documentation with:
  - List of already-tested functions
  - Priority order for implementation
  - Test quality tracking system

### 3. Key Insights from Planning
- Pure utility functions (Category 1) should have natural tests
- CLI handlers (Category 7) may need integration tests instead
- Test quality (natural vs contrived) is more important than coverage %
- Contrived tests indicate potential refactoring opportunities

### 4. Refactoring Already Completed
- Successfully eliminated duplicated category logic (8 instances)
- Created `get_category_from_score()` and `get_category_speed()` helpers
- Added comprehensive tests for the new functions
- Improved coverage from 40.01% to 41.27%

## Current State
- All 70 tests passing
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Testing pure utility functions
- Clear roadmap to 100% coverage with quality focus

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 1**: Test 9 pure utility functions (format_duration, etc.)
2. **Phase 2**: Test business logic and data prep functions
3. **Phase 3**: Test I/O and network functions with appropriate mocking
4. **Phase 4**: Evaluate CLI handlers for unit vs integration testing

## Key Decisions Made
- Prioritize test quality over coverage metrics
- Document functions that need refactoring
- Skip CLI handlers if integration tests are more appropriate
- Use test naturalness as a code quality indicator

## Test Quality Categories
- ✅ Natural test = good code
- ⚠️ Somewhat contrived = consider refactoring  
- ❌ Very contrived = needs refactoring
- ⏭️ Skipped = better as integration test

## Files Created/Modified
1. `/docs/development/FUNCTION_COVERAGE_PLAN_20250604_084639.md` - Comprehensive plan
2. `/sessions/SESSION_20250604_COVERAGE_BASELINE.md` - Current state baseline
3. `/sessions/SESSION_20250106_CATEGORY_REFACTORING.md` - Refactoring documentation
4. `src/main.rs` - Added helper functions and tests

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Check current coverage
cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --ignore-filename-regex "src/bin/.*"

# Run tests for verification
cargo test

# Generate detailed HTML report
cargo llvm-cov --html --ignore-filename-regex "src/bin/.*"

# Start with Phase 1 functions:
# - format_duration
# - estimate_distance_from_name  
# - default_sport
# - get_multi_lap_distance
```

## Session Summary
Created a systematic plan to achieve 100% function coverage while maintaining focus on test quality. The approach prioritizes natural tests over coverage metrics and uses test difficulty as an indicator of code quality. Ready to begin implementation in Phase 1.
