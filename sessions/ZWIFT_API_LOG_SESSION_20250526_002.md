# Zwift API Log - Session 2025-05-26 Part 2

## Session: UX Improvements & Test Planning

### Context
Continued from previous session after discovering most users struggled with default search parameters returning no results.

### UX Problem Analysis
User testing revealed poor experience:
- Default search (90-120min races) typically found nothing
- Users needed 5+ attempts to find useful results
- No guidance on what to try next
- Key insight: Most races are 20-30 minutes, not 90-120 minutes

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Event Type Summary
Added event counting after fetch:
```rust
// Count events by type for informative output
let mut event_counts = std::collections::HashMap::new();
for event in &events {
    if event.sport.to_uppercase() == "CYCLING" {
        *event_counts.entry(event.event_type.as_str()).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
}
```

Output: "Found: 91 group rides, 52 races, 33 group workouts, 5 time trials"

#### 2. Context-Aware No Results Messages
Implemented smart suggestions based on search type:
```rust
if args.event_type == "race" {
    println!("\nMost races are short (20-30 minutes). Try:");
    println!("  • {} for short races", "cargo run -- -d 30 -t 30".yellow());
    println!("  • {} for any race duration", "cargo run -- -d 60 -t 120".yellow());
}
```

### Testing Results
All scenarios tested successfully:
- Short races (`-d 30 -t 30`): Found 28 events
- Time trials (`-e tt`): Helpful rarity message
- All events (`-e all -d 60 -t 180`): Found 143 events
- Group rides (`-e group`): Found 9 matching rides

### Test Coverage Planning

Created comprehensive test plan with 6 categories:

1. **Unit Tests Needed**
   - Racing Score event functions (critical)
   - Distance parsing functions
   - User/category functions
   - Caching mechanisms

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Event count display
   - No results messaging
   - Command example validation

3. **Edge Cases**
   - API response handling
   - Route data extremes
   - Time/date edge cases

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network failures
   - Database errors

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Large dataset handling

6. **Mock Requirements**
   - External dependencies

Target: >80% code coverage

### Technical Decisions
- Used HashMap for efficient event counting
- Color-coded suggestions for better visibility
- Kept messages concise but informative
- Examples use actual working commands

### Commit & Deploy
- All changes committed with comprehensive message
- Successfully pushed to GitHub
- Production ready with improved UX

### Key Learnings
1. **User expectations vs reality** - Default assumptions were wrong
2. **Show, don't just tell** - Event counts provide immediate context
3. **Guide to success** - Working examples reduce trial and error
4. **Test planning matters** - Systematic approach ensures quality

### Next Steps
1. Implement Racing Score event tests (highest priority)
2. Add integration tests for UX features
3. Consider changing default duration to 60 minutes
