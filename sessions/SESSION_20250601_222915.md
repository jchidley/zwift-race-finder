# Session 20250601_222915
Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done
- Reviewed current code state after recent configuration management implementation
- Tested description parsing feature with live Zwift API data
- Successfully verified that the parse_description_data() function is working correctly:
  - Parses distance from event descriptions (e.g., "20.5 km")
  - Parses elevation from descriptions (e.g., "191 m elevation")
  - Parses lap counts when present in descriptions
  - Displays parsed data with "From description:" line in event output
- Confirmed all 28 tests are passing, including the new parse_description_data test
- Encountered temporary DNS resolution issues with api.zwift.com (environmental issue)

## Technical Insights
- Description parsing implementation uses regex patterns to extract:
  - Distance patterns: "Distance: X km", "X kilometers", etc.
  - Elevation patterns: "Elevation: X m", "X meters elevation", etc.
  - Lap patterns: "X laps"
- The tool shows both API-provided data and description-parsed data separately for clarity
- Racing Score events (with distanceInMeters: 0) benefit from description parsing to show actual race distance

## Failed Approaches
- None in this session - description parsing was already implemented and working

## Commits
No commits made during this session (reviewing existing implementation)
