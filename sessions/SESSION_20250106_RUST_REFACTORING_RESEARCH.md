# Session: Rust Refactoring Research and Documentation
Date: 2025-01-06

## Summary
Created comprehensive Rust-specific refactoring documentation based on deep research of available tools and best practices.

## What Was Done

### 1. Research Phase
- Investigated Rust refactoring tools (rust-analyzer, IntelliJ Rust, cargo ecosystem)
- Researched static analysis tools (clippy, cargo fix)
- Explored code transformation tools (rerast, syn-rsx)
- Studied Rust-specific refactoring patterns and anti-patterns
- Examined best practices for ownership, async/await, and performance

### 2. Documentation Created

#### RUST_REFACTORING_RULES.md
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Core principles for mechanical refactoring in Rust
- Tool setup and IDE configuration
- Catalog of 10 common refactoring patterns with examples
- Ownership and borrowing considerations
- Module system refactoring strategies
- Error handling patterns
- Performance-preserving techniques
- Testing strategies during refactoring
- Async/await migration patterns
- Macro refactoring
- Safety checklist and common pitfalls
- Incremental refactoring strategies

#### RUST_REFACTORING_TOOLS.md
Quick reference including:
- Essential tool installation commands
- IDE setup for VS Code, IntelliJ, and Neovim
- Common refactoring commands and shortcuts
- Tool-specific usage examples
- Refactoring workflows for common tasks
- Project health check commands
- Useful shell aliases
- Troubleshooting tips

## Key Insights

### 1. Rust-Specific Refactoring Principles
- **Compiler-driven**: Rust's type system acts as a safety net
- **Ownership-aware**: Refactoring must consider borrowing rules
- **Zero-cost**: Maintain performance characteristics
- **Incremental**: Small, atomic changes with continuous validation

### 2. Primary Tools
- **rust-analyzer**: The cornerstone of Rust refactoring
  - Extract function/module/variable
  - Inline operations
  - Pattern conversions (if/else ↔ match)
  - Rename with project-wide updates
  
- **Cargo ecosystem**:
  - `cargo fix`: Automated fixes
  - `cargo clippy`: Improvement suggestions
  - `cargo-edit`: Dependency management
  - `cargo-mutants`: Test effectiveness validation
  - `cargo-machete`: Find unused dependencies

### 3. Unique Rust Considerations
- Module visibility progression (private → pub(crate) → pub)
- Iterator chain preservation for lazy evaluation
- Strategic use of const generics and inlining
- Careful async/await propagation
- Minimizing unsafe code surface area

## Files Created
1. `/home/jack/tools/rust/zwift-race-finder/RUST_REFACTORING_RULES.md` - Main refactoring guide
2. `/home/jack/tools/rust/zwift-race-finder/RUST_REFACTORING_TOOLS.md` - Tool quick reference

## Next Steps
These documents can now guide future refactoring efforts in the zwift-race-finder project and other Rust projects. The mechanical refactoring approach combined with Rust's safety guarantees provides a robust framework for code evolution.
