# Session 2025-05-27-008: Comprehensive Requirements Review

## Session Summary
Completed a systematic review of all 41 project *.md files to update REQUIREMENTS.md based on the latest user needs, with recent requests taking precedence over earlier ones.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Created FILES_REVIEW_LIST.md
- Listed all 41 *.md files sorted by modification time (newest first)
- Tracked review status for each file
- Documented key findings and priority issues

### 2. Systematic File Review Process
Reviewed files in order of recency to ensure latest user needs took precedence:
- Started with todo.md, HANDOFF.md (most recent)
- Reviewed all session logs from newest to oldest
- Examined security, configuration, and technical documentation
- Extracted requirements from each relevant file

### 3. Major Requirements Updates

#### Security Requirements (NFR-7.6 through NFR-7.8)
- Use secure token storage (Bitwarden, GPG, or secure directory)
- Pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental secret commits
- Replace personal data with placeholders before public release
- Support multiple secure configuration options

#### Configuration Requirements (DR-13.5 through DR-13.7)
- Configuration loading priority: local → secure dir → env vars → defaults
- Separate secrets from non-secret configuration
- Support personal wrappers that auto-load configuration

#### Physics Modeling Requirements (FER-19.5 through FER-19.8)
- Use height/weight for aerodynamic drag calculations
- Adjust draft benefit based on rider height
- Factor power-to-weight ratio for climbing predictions
- Consider bike choice effects (TT vs road bike)

### 4. Critical Discoveries Documented
Added new section "Critical Discoveries from Development":
- Pack Dynamics Model (82.6% variance explained)
- Event Type Systems (Traditional vs Racing Score)
- Route Discovery Insights (manual mapping > automated)
- AI Development Model (human expertise + AI implementation)

## Discoveries

### Highest Priority Issues Identified
1. **User Functionality Concern**: "I'm not convinced that the program is working as I'd like"
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: OAuth tokens stored in plain text files
3. **Configuration Management**: Need seamless personal config that survives sanitization
4. **Physics Modeling**: Height/weight data collected but underutilized
5. **API Limitations**: 200 event hard limit needs clear user communication

### Key Technical Insights
- Pack dynamics create binary state (with pack or dropped)
- 50% of events affected by Racing Score vs Traditional categorization
- Most "unknown routes" are custom event names needing manual mapping
- Multi-lap pattern matching reduced errors from 533% to 16%

## Technical Details

### Files Reviewed (41 total)
All files marked with ✅ in FILES_REVIEW_LIST.md, including:
- Session logs (ZWIFT_API_LOG_SESSION_*)
- Project documentation (README.md, HANDOFF.md, todo.md)
- Technical guides (DEPLOYMENT.md, FEEDBACK.md, SECURITY_AUDIT.md)
- Development insights (PROJECT_WISDOM.md, AI_DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Configuration docs (BITWARDEN_SETUP.md, CLAUDE.md)

### REQUIREMENTS.md Structure Enhanced
1. Added "PRIORITY UPDATE" section at top
2. Expanded "Critical Discoveries from Development"
3. Enhanced security and configuration sections
4. Added physics modeling details
5. Updated revision history with comprehensive review

## Next Session Priority
**Investigate specific user functionality concerns**. The user stated they're not convinced the program is working as they'd like. Need to:
1. Get specific examples of problematic behavior
2. Test various real-world scenarios
3. Identify gaps between expectations and actual functionality
4. Develop action plan to address concerns

## Status for Next Session
REQUIREMENTS.md is now comprehensive and up-to-date with all discovered needs. The highest priority remains addressing the user's functionality concerns, followed by security improvements for OAuth token storage.
