# Session 20250601_224500
Project: Zwift Race Finder

## Work Done
- Reviewed zwiftmap.com and zwift-data npm package for architectural inspiration
- Discovered comprehensive route database in zwift-data with 500+ routes including surface types
- Cloned three reference repositories for local searching:
  - zwiftmap-reference (573 TypeScript/JavaScript files)
  - zwift-data-reference (43 TypeScript files with route data)
  - zwift-client-reference (13 Python files with API patterns)
- Added all reference repos to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
- Comprehensive review of REQUIREMENTS.md against all reference sources
- Added 15+ new requirements based on discoveries:
  - Lead-in distance handling (critical for accuracy)
  - Route slug support for URL generation
  - Hidden event tags and URL-based filtering
  - OAuth token refresh
  - Route completion tracking
  - External URL storage (Strava, Zwift Insider, What's on Zwift)
- Updated HANDOFF.md with current context and next steps

## Technical Insights
- zwift-data package contains complete route metadata with IDs, slugs, distances, elevation
- Lead-in distances vary by event type (race vs workout vs group ride) - critical for accuracy
- Surface types include cobbles, dirt, wood, brick, grass, snow (mixed terrain impacts)
- ZwiftHacks uses hidden event tags for advanced filtering (not visible in standard API)
- All three reference projects are MIT licensed, allowing for inspiration and learning

## Failed Approaches
- Attempted to find ZwiftHacks GitHub repository - it's a web app without public source
- Initial file edits had string matching issues due to line ending discrepancies
