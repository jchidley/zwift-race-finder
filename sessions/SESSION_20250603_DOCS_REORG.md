# Session: Documentation Reorganization
Date: 2025-06-03
Duration: ~15 minutes

## Objective
Organize project documentation into a proper directory structure to keep the root directory clean.

## Starting State
- 31 markdown files in project root
- Mix of active docs, historical records, guides, and research
- Root directory cluttered with documentation

## Changes Made

### 1. Identified Essential Root Files
Files that should stay in root:
- `README.md` - Standard project overview
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Feature tracking
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions
- `HANDOFF.md` - Current project state
- `todo.md` - Active development tasks

### 2. Created Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── development/    # Process docs, logs, planning
├── research/       # Technical research and analysis
├── guides/         # Setup and operational guides
├── archive/        # Historical handoffs and logs
├── screenshots/    # Visual documentation
└── README.md       # Documentation guide
```

### 3. Moved Files
- 15 files → docs/development/ (API logs, accuracy timeline, planning)
- 4 files → docs/research/ (route mapping, ZwiftHacks analysis)
- 6 files → docs/guides/ (setup, deployment, security)
- 4 files → docs/archive/ (historical handoffs)
- 1 file → docs/ (PROJECT_WISDOM.md)

### 4. Updated References
Fixed references in:
- README.md: Updated ZWIFT_API_LOG.md path
- CLAUDE.md: Updated all API log paths
- HANDOFF.md: Updated research document paths

## Results
- ✅ Root directory reduced from 31 to 5 markdown files
- ✅ Documentation organized by topic
- ✅ All references updated
- ✅ Clean git history (proper moves, not delete/create)
- ✅ Added docs/README.md explaining structure

## Key Decision
Kept ACCURACY_TIMELINE.md as it contains unique historical data showing the progression from 92.8% → 31.2% → 25.1% → 36.9% → 25.7% → 16.1% accuracy, with detailed explanations of what changed at each stage. This development history is valuable and not fully captured elsewhere.

## Next Steps
- Project remains production ready
- Documentation now more maintainable
- Consider adding more visual documentation to screenshots/
