# Session: Table Output Format and Filter Statistics Implementation
Date: 2025-06-03 12:48:00 UTC

## Summary
This session successfully implemented two major features for the Zwift Race Finder:
1. **Table-based output format** as the default display mode with --verbose flag for detailed view
2. **Filter statistics tracking** to show users why events were filtered out with actionable fixes

## Completed Tasks
All tasks from the todo list were successfully completed:
- ✅ Add --verbose flag to Args struct
- ✅ Create table-based output formatter for compact display
- ✅ Refactor print_event() to support both table and verbose modes
- ✅ Calculate total distance including lead-in for table display
- ✅ Add route info indicator (✓) for known routes
- ✅ Test table output with various event types
- ✅ Track and display filtered out events with reasons
- ✅ Add actionable fix suggestions for filtered events

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Table Output Format
- Added `EventTableRow` struct to hold formatted data for table display
- Created `print_events_table()` function for table formatting with dynamic column widths
- Created `prepare_event_row()` to format individual events for table display
- Modified main function to use table by default, verbose with --verbose flag
- Table columns: Event Name | Time | Distance | Duration | Route ✓

### 2. Filter Statistics
- Added `FilterStats` struct to track reasons for filtering:
  - sport_filtered: Non-cycling events
  - time_filtered: Events outside date range
  - type_filtered: Wrong event type (race/tt/group/etc)
  - tag_filtered: Tag inclusion/exclusion filters
  - completed_routes_filtered: Already completed routes
  - duration_filtered: Outside duration tolerance
  - unknown_routes: Events with unmapped route IDs
  - missing_distance: Events with no distance data
- Modified `filter_events()` to return both filtered events and statistics
- Created `display_filter_stats()` to show summary with actionable fixes

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clean, scannable table format reduces visual clutter
- Filter statistics help users understand why events aren't showing
- Actionable commands provided:
  - `cargo run --bin zwift-race-finder -- --discover-routes` for unknown routes
  - `sql/mappings/manual_route_mappings.sql` for manual mapping
  - Suggestions for tolerance/duration adjustments
- Works seamlessly in both table and verbose modes

## Code Quality
- Fixed all compiler warnings
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Clean separation of concerns between display and logic
- Comprehensive testing with various scenarios

## Example Output
```
Found 26 matching events:

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Event Name                 │ Time         │ Distance    │ Duration │ Route ✓
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Glasgow Crit Circuit      │ Tue 01:10 PM │ 18.2 km (6x) │ 39m     │ ✓
Downtown Dolphin          │ Tue 02:40 PM │ 19.7 km (10x)│ 38m     │ ✓
[...]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Filter Summary: 174 events filtered out
  • 20 non-cycling events
  • 122 events of wrong type
  • 32 events outside duration range

Tip: Many events filtered by duration
  • Try wider tolerance: --tolerance 60
  • Or different duration: --duration 60
```

## Next Steps
With the table output and filter statistics complete, potential future enhancements:
1. Export table to CSV/JSON formats
2. Add sorting options (by time, duration, distance)
3. Historical analysis of filter patterns
4. Integration with route discovery tools

## Files Modified
- `/home/jack/tools/rust/zwift-race-finder/src/main.rs`:
  - Added --verbose flag to Args struct
  - Added EventTableRow and FilterStats structs
  - Modified filter_events() to return statistics
  - Added print_events_table() and prepare_event_row()
  - Added display_filter_stats()
  - Updated main() to use new features
  - Updated all test functions for new signatures

## Performance Impact
Minimal - the statistics tracking adds negligible overhead and the table formatting is actually more efficient than the verbose output for large result sets.
