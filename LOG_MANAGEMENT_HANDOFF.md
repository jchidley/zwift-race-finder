# Project: Log Management System
Updated: 2025-05-26 13:30 UTC

## Current State
Status: âœ… Implemented - 13x context reduction achieved
Target: Keep loaded context under 5KB while preserving all data
Latest: Migration complete, old logs archived, commands updated

## Essential Context
- Problem: 66KB+ logs were slowing down LLM context loading
- Solution: Hierarchical structure (Summary/Recent/Archives)
- Key insight: Session-based archives solve "when does day end" problem
- Pattern matching (*_LOG.md) handles flexible log names
- /log command updated to handle new structure

## Next Step
Apply same pattern to any project log that exceeds 10KB

## If Blocked
See LOG_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for implementation details
