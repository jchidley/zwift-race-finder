# Files to Clean Up

These files were created during the project context manager development and have been copied to `/home/jack/tools/project-context-manager/`. They can be safely deleted from this directory.

## Files Created in This Session

### Context Management Design Files
- GIT_CONTEXT_INSIGHTS.md
- GITHUB_CONTEXT_INSIGHTS.md
- UNIFIED_CONTEXT_PLAN.md
- PROJECT_CONTEXT_PLAN.md

### Implementation Files
- pc_prototype.sh
- pc_enhanced.sh
- pc_unified_prototype.sh

### Log Management Files (from the original problem)
- LOG_MANAGEMENT_HANDOFF.md
- LOG_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md
- LOG_MANAGEMENT_TODO.md
- LOG_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

### Modified Files (need review before reverting)
- ZWIFT_API_LOG.md (restructured as index)
- ZWIFT_API_LOG_SUMMARY.md (created)
- ZWIFT_API_LOG_RECENT.md (created)
- PROJECT_WISDOM.md (restructured as index)
- PROJECT_WISDOM_SUMMARY.md (created)
- PROJECT_WISDOM_RECENT.md (created)

### Created Directories
- sessions/ (contains archived logs)
- ~/.project-contexts/log-management/ (the preserved context)

## Cleanup Commands

To remove the copied files:
```bash
# Remove design and implementation files
rm -f GIT_CONTEXT_INSIGHTS.md GITHUB_CONTEXT_INSIGHTS.md UNIFIED_CONTEXT_PLAN.md PROJECT_CONTEXT_PLAN.md
rm -f pc_prototype.sh pc_enhanced.sh pc_unified_prototype.sh
rm -f LOG_MANAGEMENT_*.md LOG_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

# The hierarchical log files should probably be kept as they're now the active system
# But if you want to revert to the original structure, you'd need to:
# 1. Restore from the sessions/ archives
# 2. Delete the SUMMARY and RECENT files
```

## Note
The hierarchical log structure (ZWIFT_API_LOG_SUMMARY.md, etc.) is actually useful for the zwift-race-finder project and should probably be kept. Only the project context manager files need cleanup.
