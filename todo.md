# Zwift Race Finder - TODO

## üìä Current Status
- **Prediction Error**: 31.2% (down from 92.8%!)
- **Real Race Data**: 151 races from Strava
- **Next Goal**: Get below 30% error using physics model

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Post-Cleanup Tasks

### Step 1: Test Everything After Cleanup ‚ö° IN PROGRESS
```bash
# Test core functionality
cargo test
cargo run -- --help
cargo run  # Should show upcoming races

# Test imports still work
./import_zwiftpower_dev.sh --help

# Check scripts have correct permissions
ls -la *.sh | grep -v "rwx"
```

### Step 2: Commit Cleanup to GitHub
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: major cleanup - remove dead code and rename files

- Removed 28 obsolete files (old extractors, abandoned approaches)
- Renamed files for clarity (extract_zwiftpower_v2 ‚Üí zwiftpower_profile_extractor)
- Kept zwiftpower_event_extractor.js for future individual event scraping
- Updated documentation to reflect new filenames"
git push
```

## üéØ THEN: Get Real Race Data

### Step 3: Run Strava Import 
```bash
cd ~/tools/rust/zwift-race-finder
./strava_auth.sh                    # Authenticate with Strava
./strava_fetch_activities.sh        # Download your races  
./strava_import_to_db.sh           # Import REAL times
python strava_analyze.py           # Check your actual speeds
```

### Step 4: Fix KISS Racing Distance
```sql
-- Run this after Strava import
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/zwift-race-finder/races.db \
  "UPDATE routes SET distance_km = 35.0 WHERE route_id = 2474227587;"
```

### Step 5: Run Regression Test
```bash
cargo test regression_test -- --nocapture
# Should see MASSIVE improvement from 92.8% error!
```

## üìä Only After Real Data Is Imported

### Fix Remaining Routes (as needed)
- [ ] Check any routes with >50% error
- [ ] Focus on your most frequent races
- [ ] Use Strava distances as ground truth

## üöÄ Next Phase: Get Below 30% Error

### Priority 1: Handle Multi-Lap Races
- [ ] Parse lap count from event names ("3 Laps")
- [ ] Extract distance from names ("36.6km/22.7mi")
- [ ] Create database table for multi-lap events
- [ ] Update prediction logic to multiply base route distance

### Priority 2: Physics-Based Speed Model
- [ ] Add rider stats table (height, weight, FTP)
- [ ] Implement Martin et al. (1998) power equation
- [ ] Calculate personalized CdA from height/weight
- [ ] Replace category speeds with physics calculations
- [ ] Account for elevation profiles properly

### Priority 3: More Accurate Data
- [ ] Scrape individual ZwiftPower event pages (has exact times)
- [ ] Import power data from Strava (for FTP estimation)
- [ ] Build route elevation profiles database
- [ ] Map more routes with correct distances

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Automate Strava sync (daily/weekly)
- [ ] Add weather/draft conditions toggle
- [ ] Surface-specific bike recommendations
- [ ] Real-time predictions during races (Sauce4Zwift)
- [ ] Community data sharing API
- [ ] Device emulation for automated testing

## ‚úÖ Completed Today
- [x] Major cleanup: removed 28 dead files
- [x] Renamed files with sensible names
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md and logs with new filenames
- [x] Discovered ZwiftPower event pages have actual times

## üêõ Current Known Issues
- [x] 92.8% prediction error - caused by fake "actual" times
- [ ] Route distances wrong (KISS = 100km?)
- [ ] Multi-lap races not handled correctly

## üí° The Big Lesson
**We were comparing estimates to estimates!** The "actual_minutes" in the database were calculated as distance √∑ 30 km/h, not real race times. Strava + individual ZwiftPower events have the real data we need.
