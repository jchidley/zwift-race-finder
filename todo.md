## üîí Security & Privacy Tasks

### Priority 0: Secure Token Storage
- [ ] Implement environment variable support for Strava tokens
- [ ] Add token encryption at rest
- [ ] Create secure token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Document secure deployment practices
- [ ] Consider using system keyring for token storage

## üß™ Test Coverage Improvement Plan (2025-05-26) ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE!

### Completed Test Areas
1. **Racing Score Events** (Critical - recent bug fix) ‚úÖ COMPLETE!
   - [x] Test `is_racing_score_event()` detection
   - [x] Test `parse_distance_from_description()` parsing
   - [x] Test events with distanceInMeters: 0
   - [x] Test full event filtering with Racing Score events

   - [x] Test command example accuracy (via suggestions tests)

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 25 (up from 16)
- **New Tests Added**: 9 (+56% increase)
- **Coverage Areas**: Racing Score events, UX features, edge cases
- **All Tests**: ‚úÖ PASSING

### Remaining Test Areas
3. **Core Functions** (High - no coverage)
   - [ ] Test distance parsing functions
   - [ ] Test user subgroup matching
   - [ ] Test caching mechanisms

4. **Edge Cases** (Medium)
   - [ ] Test malformed API responses
   - [ ] Test extreme route data
   - [ ] Test timezone handling

Target: >80% code coverage with all critical paths tested

## üöß In Progress: Auto Route Discovery

### Completed Route Discovery Foundation (2025-05-26)
- [x] Implemented route discovery module with web scraping
- [x] Added database table for tracking search attempts  
- [x] Created CLI option --discover-routes
- [x] Integrated discovery flow into main program
- [x] Found 189 unknown routes needing discovery
- [x] Discovered Google search scraping doesn't work (blocked/changed)
- [x] Implemented direct site search APIs (whatsonzwift.com, zwiftinsider.com)
- [x] Discovered most "unknown routes" are custom event names, not route names

### Priority 0: Parse Event Descriptions ‚≠ê NEXT PRIORITY
- [ ] Parse event descriptions to extract route names and lap counts
  - Many events mention "3 laps of Volcano Circuit" or "2x Mountain Route"
  - Could identify actual route names within custom event names
  - Would solve the event name vs route name mismatch
- [ ] Create regex patterns to match common formats:
  - "X laps of [Route Name]"
  - "[Route Name] x Y"
  - "Stage X: [Route Name]"
  - "[Route Name] (Z laps)"
- [ ] Test on high-frequency unknown events first

### Priority 1: Alternative Approaches
- [ ] Build manual mapping table for recurring events
  - "EVO CC Race Series" ‚Üí rotates through specific routes
  - "KISS Racing" ‚Üí usually specific criterium routes
- [ ] Add community submission process for route mappings
- [ ] Consider parsing ZwiftPower event pages for route info

### Priority 2: Optimize Discovery for High-Value Routes
- [ ] Prioritize high-frequency unknown routes
  - Stage 4: Makuri May (68 occurrences)
  - Restart Monday Mash (42 occurrences)
  - TEAM VTO POWERPUSH (37 occurrences)
  - Focus on routes with >10 occurrences first

## üéØ Next Phase: Get Below 20% Error

### Priority 1: Refine Pack Dynamics Model
- [x] Implemented simplified pack-based model
- [ ] Analyze races with highest prediction errors
- [ ] Account for race size (bigger fields = more consistent draft)
- [ ] Consider route-specific pack dynamics (climbs split packs)
- [ ] Add time-of-day factor (peak hours = bigger fields)
- [ ] Test impact of category density on pack formation

### Priority 2: Better Route Data
- [ ] Build elevation profile database
- [ ] Add grade-specific speed calculations
- [ ] Import more route mappings from ZwiftHacks
- [ ] Handle surface-specific rolling resistance

### Priority 3: Enhanced Data Collection
- [ ] Scrape individual ZwiftPower event pages for exact times
- [ ] Import power data from Strava (for FTP estimation)
- [ ] Add route elevation profiles from ZwiftHacks API
- [ ] Track draft vs non-draft events

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Near Term
- [ ] Add database backup automation
- [ ] Add time trial support (no draft calculation)
- [ ] Surface-specific bike recommendations
- [ ] Weather condition effects (if Zwift adds them)
- [ ] Automate weekly Strava sync
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline with automated tests

### Long Term
- [ ] Real-time predictions during races (Sauce4Zwift API)
- [ ] Community data sharing API
- [ ] Device emulation for automated testing
- [ ] Machine learning model from race history
- [ ] Power-based pacing recommendations

## üêõ Current Known Issues
- [x] ~~Racing Score events have distanceInMeters: 0~~ - FIXED! (2025-05-26)
- [ ] Some routes still need distance corrections
- [ ] Network connectivity affects API calls
- [ ] Category E not properly mapped (treated as D)
- [ ] Race series (like EVO CC) run different routes each week
- [ ] Some struct fields show as "never read" but are used in DB queries

## üí° Key Learnings

### Technical Discoveries
1. **Event subgroups are crucial** - Different categories race different distances
2. **Real data beats estimates** - Strava integration was game-changing
3. **Draft matters** - 30.9 km/h in races vs 25 km/h solo
4. **Multi-lap races** - Must use total distance, not base route
5. **Route mapping critical** - Wrong mapping (EVO CC) caused 11.2% accuracy drop
6. **Test coverage essential** - Comprehensive tests prevent regression
7. **Racing Score events different** - API returns distanceInMeters: 0, distance in description only
8. **Two event systems** - Traditional (A/B/C/D) vs Racing Score (0-650 ranges) are mutually exclusive
9. **Site search tip** - Use `site:https://whatsonzwift.com` to find accurate route data
10. **UX matters** - Event type counts and smart suggestions reduce user friction significantly

### AI Development Insights
1. **Domain knowledge essential** - Knowing Zwift racing guided better solutions
2. **Technical experience valuable** - 40 years IT helped spot issues and guide architecture
3. **Management approach works** - Treating AI as enthusiastic employee needing direction
4. **Transparency enables debugging** - Seeing AI's reasoning catches problems early
5. **Data validates assumptions** - Real-world testing revealed multiple wrong assumptions
