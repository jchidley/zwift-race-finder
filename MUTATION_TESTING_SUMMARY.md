# Mutation Testing Summary

## Work Completed

### 1. Function Mapping
Created comprehensive mapping of functions from old mutation results (when in main.rs) to their current locations after refactoring:
- `prepare_event_row` → event_display.rs:495
- `print_events_table` → event_display.rs:600  
- `display_filter_stats` → event_display.rs:709
- And many more (see mutation_mapping.md)

### 2. Mutation Analysis
Analyzed 649 missed mutations and identified key patterns:
- Arithmetic operators: `*` → `+`, `/` → `*`, `-` → `+`
- Comparison operators: `>` → `<`, `==` → `!=`, `<=` → `>`
- Boolean operators: `&&` → `||`
- Assignment operators: `+=` → `*=`, `+=` → `-=`
- Return value mutations: returning empty/default values

### 3. New Tests Added

#### event_display.rs
- `test_display_filter_stats_empty_case` - Tests == vs != mutation on line 717
- `test_prepare_event_row_multi_lap_calculation` - Tests * vs + mutation on line 515
- `test_display_distance_based_duration_conversion` - Tests / vs % mutation on line 271
- `test_filter_stats_boundary_conditions` - Tests various filter stat edge cases

#### main.rs
- `test_analyze_event_descriptions_counter` - Tests += vs -= mutation on line 748

### 4. Key Insights from Mutation Testing

1. **Not all mutations need fixing** - As per mutants.rs documentation, mutation testing complements code coverage but 100% mutation coverage isn't the goal

2. **High-value mutations identified**:
   - Multi-lap race calculations (critical for accuracy)
   - Unit conversions (meters to km, hours to minutes)
   - Filter statistics calculations
   - Counter/accumulator operations

3. **Many mutations are in old code locations** - The mutation results reference functions that have since been moved from main.rs to other modules during refactoring

### 5. Files Created
- `mutation_mapping.md` - Maps old function locations to new ones
- `mutation_analysis.md` - Identifies critical mutations to address

## Results

- Successfully added targeted tests for the most critical mutations
- All new tests are passing
- Tests specifically target arithmetic and comparison mutations that could affect race duration calculations
- Improved confidence in multi-lap race calculations and unit conversions

## Recommendations

1. Re-run mutation testing with current code structure to get accurate results
2. Focus on mutations in calculation-heavy code (duration estimation, distance calculations)
3. Consider property-based testing for arithmetic operations
4. Don't aim for 100% mutation coverage - focus on business-critical paths
