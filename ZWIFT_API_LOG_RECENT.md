# Zwift API Log - Recent Sessions

## Session: Configuration Management Implementation (2025-05-27-010)
**Goal**: Implement flexible configuration system (Priority 2 from REQUIREMENTS.md)

### Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive configuration management with TOML format, environment variable overrides, and multiple config locations. Added FTP field to personal data, created user-friendly documentation, and maintained backward compatibility.

**Key Results**:
- Enhanced config system with env var overrides and save functionality
- Created CONFIG_MANAGEMENT.md and SIMULATION_TOOLS.md documentation
- All 35 tests passing with backward compatibility maintained
- Ready for physics modeling with height/weight/FTP data

**Status**: Configuration requirement COMPLETE - Ready for Priority 3 (Physics)

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Flexible Configuration**:
   - TOML format with clear structure
   - Environment variable overrides for all fields
   - Multi-level loading: env → local → ~/.config → ~/.local/share → defaults
   - Save functionality for user data directory

2. **Documentation**:
   - CONFIG_MANAGEMENT.md - Complete user guide
   - SIMULATION_TOOLS.md - Testing tools reference
   - Updated README with configuration section

3. **Testing Results**:
   - Config file loading: ✅
   - Environment overrides: ✅
   - Command line integration: ✅

### Next Session Priority

## Session: Secure OAuth Token Storage Implementation (2025-05-27-009)
**Goal**: Implement secure storage for OAuth tokens to address HIGH priority security requirement

### Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive secure storage solution with three backends: environment variables (CI/CD), system keyring (desktop), and file storage (backward compatible). Created migration scripts and documentation while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

**Key Results**:
- Created `src/secure_storage.rs` with automatic backend detection
- Built migration scripts: `strava_auth_secure.sh`, `strava_fetch_activities_secure.sh`
- Added comprehensive documentation: SECURE_TOKEN_MIGRATION.md
- All tests passing, ready for production use

**Status**: Security requirement COMPLETE - Ready for next priority

## Session: Comprehensive Requirements Review (2025-05-27-008)
**Goal**: Review all project documentation and update REQUIREMENTS.md based on latest user needs

### Summary
Systematically reviewed all 41 *.md files in the project to capture requirements, with the most recent user needs taking precedence. User clarified that creating comprehensive requirements documentation WAS the solution to their "not working as I'd like" concern. Tool verified working correctly with all tests passing.

**Key Results**:
- Created FILES_REVIEW_LIST.md to track systematic review of 41 files
- Created comprehensive REQUIREMENTS.md addressing all concerns
- Identified security issues: OAuth tokens in plain text (HIGH priority)
- Tool functionality verified: runs correctly, 26/26 tests pass

**Status**: Requirements gathering complete, awaiting user direction on priorities
