# OCR Telemetry Extraction Session Summary

## Session Overview
Date: 2025-01-08
Objective: Create an OCR-based telemetry extraction system for Zwift, similar to the SpaceX telemetry extraction project (AeroTelemProc_VidData).

## Work Completed

### 1. Initial Research and Planning
- Analyzed the SpaceX telemetry extraction project to understand approach
- Identified Zwift UI elements from provided screenshots
- Created todo list for systematic development

### 2. OCR Prototype Development
- Created `zwift_ocr_prototype.py` - Initial prototype comparing PaddleOCR and EasyOCR
- Defined initial regions of interest (ROI) for telemetry data
- Implemented basic text extraction and parsing

### 3. Enhanced OCR System
- Created `zwift_ocr_improved.py` with precise UI region mapping
- Implemented preprocessing pipeline for better OCR accuracy
- Added pattern matching for Zwift-specific formats

### 4. Telemetry Elements Identified and Implemented

#### Top Middle HUD
- Speed (km/h)
- Distance traveled (km)
- Current altitude (m) - initially misidentified as elevation
- Race time (mm:ss)

#### Top Left Panel
- Current power (W)
- Cadence (RPM)
- Heart rate (BPM)
- Average power (W)
- Energy expended (kJ) - initially misidentified as power/kg

#### Additional Elements
- Gradient percentage (visible during climbs in top right)
- Distance to finish (km remaining) - discovered in normal riding image (28.6km)
- XP progress bar
- Route progress bar

#### Power-ups
- Active power-up detection (Featherweight, Aero Boost, etc.)
- Circular timer analysis (starts/ends at 3 o'clock, decreases anti-clockwise)
- Remaining duration estimation

#### Rider Leaderboard
- Rider names
- Watts per kg (w/kg)
- Distance traveled (km) - initially misidentified as speed
- Position gaps (except for current rider)

### 5. Video Processing Pipeline
- Created `zwift_video_processor.py` for processing video streams
- Multi-threaded OCR processing with queue system
- Storage backends: SQLite, CSV, JSON
- Real-time preview with extraction overlay
- Performance tracking and FPS monitoring

### 6. Rider Pose Detection

#### Initial Implementation (Incorrect)
Based on provided filenames, initially assumed:
- normal_tuck = HIGH DRAG
- normal_normal = NORMAL DRAG
- climbing_seated = NORMAL DRAG
- climbing_standing = HIGH DRAG

#### Research Discovery
After extensive research on Zwift mechanics:
- **Most positions are visual only** - no aerodynamic impact!
- Aerodynamics determined solely by height/weight
- Only **supertuck** position affects speed (-25% drag)
- Regular positions are just visual feedback for realism

#### Final Implementation
- `rider_pose_detector.py` - Advanced pose detection with feature extraction
- Detects: seated_hoods, seated_drops, standing, supertuck
- Uses contour analysis, aspect ratios, center of mass calculations
- Includes calibration system for training on sample images

### 7. Key Technical Decisions

#### OCR Engine Selection
- Chose to support both PaddleOCR and EasyOCR
- PaddleOCR: Faster, good with numbers (~85% accuracy)
- EasyOCR: Easier setup, slightly slower (~80% accuracy)

#### Image Preprocessing
- Convert to grayscale
- CLAHE for contrast enhancement
- Threshold to isolate white text (Zwift UI characteristic)
- 2x upscaling for better OCR accuracy

#### Architecture Patterns
- Region-based extraction with precise coordinates
- Pattern matching for value parsing
- Modular design for easy extension
- Multi-format output for flexibility

## Discoveries and Corrections

### Major Corrections Made
1. **Altitude vs Elevation**: Top HUD shows current altitude, not elevation gain
2. **Distance vs Speed**: Leaderboard shows distance traveled (km), not speed
3. **Energy vs Power/kg**: Left panel shows energy expended (kJ), not watts/kg
4. **Rider Positions**: Completely revised understanding based on research

### Zwift-Specific Insights
1. **Supertuck Mechanics**:
   - Only activates on steep descents (≥-3%) at high speed
   - Must be at 0 watts and not drafting
   - Cannot activate on TT or MTB bikes
   - Can stack with Aero power-up

2. **Visual Position Rules**:
   - Hoods/Drops: Based on speed (≥33 km/h) and drafting status
   - Standing: Triggered by cadence (31-72 RPM) on climbs ≥3%
   - Tron bike: No position changes at all

3. **Power-up Timer**:
   - Circular timer starts/ends at 3 o'clock position
   - Decreases anti-clockwise
   - Visual analysis possible through bright pixel detection

## Files Created

### Core Implementation

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements
1. Automatic UI scale detection for different resolutions
2. Support for different screen resolutions beyond 1920x1080
3. Real-time streaming to external applications
4. Integration with existing race finder database

### Advanced Features
1. Power curve analysis from telemetry
2. Segment effort tracking
3. Draft detection and efficiency calculation
4. Automated race analysis reports
5. Machine learning for improved pose detection

### Integration Opportunities
1. Connect with Zwift race finder for duration validation
2. Build personalized prediction models from telemetry
3. Track performance metrics across races
4. Analyze pacing strategies

## Lessons Learned

### Technical
- OCR accuracy heavily depends on preprocessing
- Region-based extraction more reliable than full-screen OCR
- Pattern matching essential for game-specific formats
- Visual feedback doesn't always correlate with game mechanics

### Zwift-Specific
- Game physics simplified compared to real cycling
- Visual realism prioritized over physical accuracy
- Community resources (Zwift Insider) invaluable for understanding mechanics
- Always verify assumptions with actual game behavior

### Process
- Start with working examples (SpaceX project)
- Iterate based on actual data analysis
- Research game mechanics to avoid incorrect assumptions
- Test with multiple scenarios and edge cases

## Conclusion

Successfully created a comprehensive OCR telemetry extraction system for Zwift that can:
- Extract all visible UI telemetry data
- Process video streams in real-time
- Detect rider positions and power-ups
- Store data in multiple formats for analysis

The system is ready for integration with the Zwift race finder tool and can serve as a foundation for advanced performance analytics and race strategy optimization.
