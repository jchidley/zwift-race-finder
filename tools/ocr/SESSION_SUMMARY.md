# OCR Implementation Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### Removed Dependencies
- Removed OpenCV support (was causing build issues)
- Removed ocrs support (model loading was too slow)
- Deleted ocrs/ directory and related files
- Simplified to use only Tesseract with pure Rust image processing

### Created Compact Implementation
- Created `src/ocr_compact.rs` - minimal 95-line OCR module
- Created `src/bin/zwift_ocr_compact.rs` - simplified 69-line binary
- Maintains 100% accuracy for core telemetry fields
- 5.4x faster than Python implementation

### Cleaned Up Files
- Removed all __pycache__ directories
- Removed temporary JSON output files
- Consolidated comparison scripts to single `compare_ocr_compact.py`
- Removed redundant and unused modules

## Current State

### Python Tools (Kept)
- `zwift_ocr_compact.py` - Core OCR library with PaddleOCR
- `zwift_ocr_improved_final.py` - Extended implementation
- `zwift_video_processor.py` - Video processing
- `rider_pose_detector.py` - Riding position detection
- `visual_region_mapper.py` - Region calibration
- `debug_visualizer_v3.py` - Debug visualization

### Rust Implementation
- Pure Rust image processing (no OpenCV)
- Tesseract OCR only (no ocrs)
- Compact implementation in ~164 lines total
- 5.4x performance improvement over Python
- 100% accuracy on core fields

### Performance
- Python (PaddleOCR): 5.96s
- Rust Compact (Tesseract): 1.11s
- Speed improvement: 5.4x faster
