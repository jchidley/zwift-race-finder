Performance: Python=12.05s, Rust=3.53s (3.4x faster)
Accuracy: 7/7 core fields match (100%)
```

## Detailed Comparison

| Implementation | Time | Core Accuracy | Leaderboard Accuracy | Architecture |
|----------------|------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Rust v1.1** | **3.53s** | **100%** | **~80%** | Tesseract + ocrs hybrid |
| Python | 12.05s | 100% | 100% | PaddleOCR neural network |
| Rust v1.0 | 0.19s | 100% | N/A | Tesseract only |

## Key Achievements

1. **Speed**: 3.4x performance improvement over Python
2. **Accuracy**: 100% on all numeric telemetry fields
3. **Leaderboard**: ~80% name recognition (significant improvement over 10% with Tesseract alone)
4. **Architecture**: Successful hybrid approach leveraging strengths of both OCR engines

## Technical Approach

### Hybrid OCR Strategy
- **Tesseract**: Used for clean numeric fields (speed, power, distance, etc.)
  - Extremely fast region-based extraction
  - Perfect accuracy on numbers with character constraints
  - Processes only ~30,000 pixels (1.5% of image)

- **ocrs**: Used for complex leaderboard text
  - Neural network approach handles stylized fonts
  - Better at anti-aliased text and UI overlays
  - Processes leaderboard region (420x600 pixels)

### Implementation Details
- Core telemetry: 9 fields extracted in 0.19s
- Leaderboard: Additional 3.34s for ocrs processing
- Pose detection: Canny edge detection for rider position
- Total: 3.53s for complete extraction

## Use Case Recommendations

1. **Production/Automation** (Rust v1.1)
   - 3.4x faster processing
   - Good accuracy for most use cases
   - Lower resource requirements

2. **Perfect Accuracy Required** (Python)
   - 100% leaderboard name recognition
   - Best for critical applications
   - Worth the 3.4x speed penalty

3. **Speed Critical** (Rust v1.0)
   - 0.19s extraction time
   - Core telemetry only
   - 63x faster than Python

## Conclusion

The hybrid Rust implementation successfully balances speed and accuracy, making it the recommended choice for most Zwift telemetry extraction use cases. The 3.4x performance improvement enables real-time processing while maintaining sufficient accuracy for practical applications.
