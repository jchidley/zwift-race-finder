# OCR Testing Improvements Summary
Date: 2025-01-10

## Performance Issue Resolution

### Problem
All OCR implementations (Python and Rust) were running ~100% slower than expected:
- Python PaddleOCR: 8-9s instead of 4-5s
- Rust Tesseract: 1.6s instead of 0.8s
- Rust OCRS: 2.7s instead of 1.3s

### Root Causes Found
1. **PaddleOCR initialization overhead**: Missing ccache causing C++ extension recompilation
2. **First-run model downloads**: Initial run downloaded models (72s total)
3. **CPU throttling on battery**: Battery power (8.24s) vs plugged in (4.58s)

### Resolution
- User installed ccache
- Models were cached after first run
- Performance returned to expected levels when plugged in

## Test Coverage Improvements

### Initial State
- 7 unit tests in ocr_compact.rs
- Mutation testing revealed 0% effectiveness in previous session

### Added Tests (5 new tests, total 13)
1. **test_parse_time_valid_formats**: Catches digit extraction logic mutations
2. **test_parse_leaderboard_data_time_delta**: Catches regex capture group mutations
3. **test_parse_leaderboard_data_distance**: Catches parse().ok() mutations
4. **test_parse_leaderboard_data_wkg**: Catches range check mutations (MIN..=MAX)
5. **test_parse_time_digit_slicing**: Specifically catches slice index mutations
6. **test_is_likely_name_multiple_dots**: Added after mutation testing found missed mutation

### Mutation Testing Results
- Found 178 mutants to test
- Baseline build time: 282.4s (very slow due to full dependency compilation)
- First missed mutation: `replace >= with < in is_likely_name` (line 290)
- Added targeted test to catch this specific mutation

## Key Learnings
1. Mutation testing is essential - it revealed our tests weren't checking the right conditions
2. Even with multiple test types, effectiveness matters more than quantity
3. Performance issues can have multiple causes - systematic investigation is key
4. Tests should verify specific behaviors, not just "something happens"

## Test Design Patterns
- Use concrete assertions with exact expected values
- Test boundary conditions explicitly
- Ensure logical operators (&&, ||) are tested with cases that fail each condition
- Test range checks at MIN-1, MIN, MAX, MAX+1
- For string slicing, test edge cases that would fail with wrong indices

## Next Steps
- Continue mutation testing to find more gaps
- Focus on functions with complex logic
- Ensure all critical parsing functions have >75% mutation coverage
