# OCR Development Log

## Session Start
- **Date**: 2025-01-08
- **Goal**: Create OCR telemetry extraction for Zwift, similar to SpaceX telemetry project
- **Initial Resources**: 2 Zwift screenshots (normal riding, climbing with gradient)

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (10:00 - 10:30)
- Examined provided screenshots
- Identified key telemetry elements
- Researched SpaceX telemetry extraction approach
- Created initial todo list

**Key Observations**:
- Zwift UI has consistent white text on semi-transparent backgrounds
- Multiple data regions with different formats
- Rider avatar in center provides pose information

### Phase 2: Prototype Development (10:30 - 11:30)
- Created `zwift_ocr_prototype.py`
- Implemented OCR engine comparison (PaddleOCR vs EasyOCR)
- Defined initial ROI coordinates
- Basic text extraction working

**Challenges**:
- Initial ROI coordinates were approximate
- Pattern matching needed refinement
- OCR accuracy varied between regions

### Phase 3: User Feedback and Corrections (11:30 - 12:00)
- User corrected initial assumptions:
  - Top bar shows altitude, not elevation
  - Leaderboard shows distance (km), not speed (km/h)
  - Left panel shows energy (kJ), not power/kg
  - Gradient box appears in top right during climbs

**Improvements Made**:
- Updated field names and parsing patterns
- Added gradient detection
- Corrected leaderboard parsing

### Phase 4: Enhanced Implementation (12:00 - 13:00)
- Created `zwift_ocr_improved.py` with precise mapping
- Implemented advanced preprocessing pipeline
- Added pattern matching for all field types
- Created visualization methods

**Technical Decisions**:
- CLAHE for contrast enhancement
- 2x upscaling for OCR accuracy
- White text threshold at 180/255

### Phase 5: Video Processing (13:00 - 14:00)
- Created `zwift_video_processor.py`
- Implemented multi-threaded processing
- Added multiple storage backends
- Real-time preview capability

**Architecture Choices**:
- Queue-based threading model
- Frame skipping for performance
- Atomic storage operations

### Phase 6: Power-up Detection (14:00 - 14:30)
- Added power-up name detection
- Implemented circular timer analysis
- Discovered timer starts at 3 o'clock, not 12

**Algorithm Development**:
- Radial sampling of bright pixels
- Anti-clockwise progress calculation
- Percentage estimation from angles

### Phase 7: Rider Pose Detection (14:30 - 16:00)
- Initial implementation based on user's file names
- Created basic pose detection
- User provided 4 example pose images
- Built advanced `rider_pose_detector.py`

**Initial Assumptions** (from filenames):
- normal_tuck.jpg = HIGH DRAG
- normal_normal_drag.jpg = NORMAL DRAG
- climbing_in_the_saddle.jpg = NORMAL DRAG
- climbing_out_of_the_saddle.jpg = HIGH DRAG

### Phase 8: Research and Major Correction (16:00 - 17:00)
- Extensive research on Zwift mechanics
- Discovered positions are mostly visual only!
- Only supertuck affects aerodynamics (-25% drag)
- Complete revision of pose detection understanding

**Key Research Findings**:
- Zwift aerodynamics based only on height/weight
- Visual positions don't affect speed
- Supertuck is the exception
- Community sources invaluable

### Phase 9: Documentation and Cleanup (17:00 - 17:30)
- Created comprehensive README
- Added research documentation
- Updated all code with correct information
- Created test scripts

### Phase 10: Version Control (17:30 - 18:00)
- Created new 'ocr' git branch
- Added all created files
- Committed with detailed message
- Created session documentation

## Key Learning Moments

### 1. Gradient Detection Discovery
User: "Looking at the climb image, the top right has a box with 5%"
- Led to adding gradient detection region
- Important for understanding riding conditions

### 2. Leaderboard Correction
User: "Let me make another correction, for both images in the leaderboard it's not km/h is km"
- Critical correction for accurate data
- Shows importance of careful observation

### 3. Power-up Timer Orientation
User: "The full circle actually starts and finishes at the 3pm position"
- Required algorithm adjustment
- Demonstrates need for precise observation

### 4. Pose Misunderstanding
User: "we have these images as example poses..."
- Initial implementation based on filenames
- Complete revision after research
- Highlight: Always verify assumptions!

### 5. Research Revelation
Discovery: "Rider posture is only used as a visual cue at this time"
- Major correction to entire approach
- Saved significant development time
- Reinforced importance of researching game mechanics

## Metrics

### Code Statistics
- Total lines of code: ~2,400
- Files created: 15
- Test coverage: Partial (visual validation)

### Performance
- OCR accuracy: ~85% (PaddleOCR)
- Processing speed: ~5 fps with frame skipping
- Memory usage: ~200MB for video processing

### Time Distribution
