# Comprehensive Testing Guide: From 0% to Effective

## The OCR Lesson That Changed Everything

On 2025-01-10, we discovered our OCR module had:
- ✅ Property tests with proptest
- ✅ Snapshot tests with insta
- ✅ Integration tests with golden data
- ✅ Fuzz tests with arbitrary inputs
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

**Mutation testing revealed: 0% effectiveness (0/234 mutations caught)**

This guide exists because that 0% proved that test quantity ≠ test quality.

## The Science: Why Traditional Metrics Fail

### Code Coverage Is Weakly Correlated with Bug Detection

Research consistently shows weak correlation between code coverage and bug detection:

- **Microsoft Research (2020)**: Found "insignificant correlation" between coverage and post-release bugs in 100 large open-source Java projects [^1]
- **Code Coverage and Test Suite Effectiveness (2015)**: Found "low to moderate correlation" when controlling for test suite size [^2]
- **Google Research (2014)**: "Coverage is not strongly correlated with test suite effectiveness" - largest study to date with 31,000 test suites [^3]

[^1]: [Code Coverage and Post-release Defects: A Large-Scale Study](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/code-coverage-and-post-release-defects-a-large-scale-study-on-open-source-projects/)
[^2]: [Code Coverage and Test Suite Effectiveness: Empirical Study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7081877/)
[^3]: [Coverage is not strongly correlated with test suite effectiveness](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2568225.2568271)

### Mutation Testing Shows Stronger (But Still Imperfect) Correlation

While often cited as superior to code coverage, recent research shows mutation testing correlation is weaker than previously thought:

- **Papadakis et al. (2018)**: "All correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size" [^4]
- **Key finding**: Test suite size is a major confounding factor
- **Practical implication**: Focus on test quality, not quantity

[^4]: [Are Mutation Scores Correlated with Real Fault Detection?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453121)

## Industry Evidence: The Reality Check

### Google's Mutation Testing at Scale

Google uses mutation testing on **1,000+ projects with 24,000+ developers**, but with crucial adaptations [^5]:

- **Incremental approach**: Only mutate changed code during code review
- **Aggressive filtering**: Remove "arid lines" and limit mutants per line
- **Historical performance**: Select mutants based on past effectiveness

[^5]: [State of Mutation Testing at Google](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3183519.3183521)

### Facebook's Sobering Discovery

Facebook's 2021 study found that **>50% of mutants survived their rigorous test suite** [^6]:

- Tested on production code with unit, integration, and system tests
- 26 developers participated in the study
- Almost half would create new tests based on surviving mutants

[^6]: [What It Would Take to Use Mutation Testing in Industry—A Study at Facebook](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9402096/)

## The Theoretical Foundation

### The Competent Programmer Hypothesis

Introduced by DeMillo, Lipton, and Sayward (1978) [^7]:
- Programmers create programs that are "close to correct"
- Most bugs are small syntactic errors
- Testing for simple errors catches complex ones

[^7]: [Hints on Test Data Selection: Help for the Practicing Programmer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1646911/)

### The Coupling Effect (Empirically Validated)

The coupling effect hypothesis states that tests detecting simple faults also detect complex ones:

- **Empirical validation**: Tests killing simple mutants killed **99% of complex mutants** [^8]
- **Theoretical support**: Multiple studies confirm the probabilistic coupling effect
- **Practical impact**: Simple mutations (+ → -, && → ||) are sufficient

[^8]: [Investigations of the software testing coupling effect](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/125489.125473)

## The Coverage Evolution Model (Industry-Validated)

### The 70% Rule: Industry Consensus

Research and industry practice converge on 70-80% as the optimal coverage target:

- **Google's Guidelines**: "60% acceptable, 75% commendable, 90% exemplary" [^9]
- **Empirical Studies**: "Increasing coverage above 70-80% leads to slow bug detection rate" [^10]
- **Industry Survey**: 47 projects across 7 languages averaged 74-76% coverage [^10]

[^9]: [Google Testing Blog: Code Coverage Best Practices](https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/08/code-coverage-best-practices.html)
[^10]: [Minimum Acceptable Code Coverage](https://www.bullseye.com/minimum.html)

### The Natural Evolution Pattern

```
New Feature (60-70%) → User Reports → Regression Tests → High Coverage (90%+)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Ship at 60-70% with quality tests (catches most bugs)
- Real users find edge cases you didn't imagine
- Add regression tests for actual failures
- Mature features naturally reach 90%+ coverage
- 100% coverage on day one = contrived tests that catch nothing

As one industry expert noted: "When you focus more on making coverage numbers better, your motivation shifts away from finding bugs" [^10]

## Core Principle: Incremental Mutation-Driven Development

The evolution from academia to industry revealed a critical shift:
- **1970s-2000s**: Write all tests → Run mutation testing → Get depressed
- **2010s-Present**: Write test → Mutate immediately → Fix → Repeat

Google's approach validates this: mutation testing happens during code review, not after.

## The Test Hierarchy: Why Each Level Matters

### 1. Unit Tests (Foundation - Catch Arithmetic/Logic Errors)
**Purpose**: Verify individual functions calculate correctly  
**Value**: Catch simple mutations that couple to complex bugs  
**When**: Write first, during development  
**Mutation Focus**: Arithmetic (+→-), comparisons (<→>), boundaries

```rust
// BAD: Only verifies structure
#[test]
fn test_calculate() {
    let result = calculate(5, 10);
    assert!(result.is_some());
}

// GOOD: Verifies correctness
#[test]
fn test_calculate() {
    assert_eq!(calculate(5, 10), Some(50));
    assert_eq!(calculate(0, 10), Some(0));
    assert_eq!(calculate(-5, 10), None); // Invalid input
}
```

### 2. Property Tests (Invariant Protection)
**Purpose**: Verify properties hold across entire input space  
**Value**: Catch edge cases unit tests miss  
**When**: After unit tests reveal complex edge cases  
**Mutation Focus**: Boolean logic (&&→||), state invariants

```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_sort_properties(mut vec: Vec<i32>) {
        let original_len = vec.len();
        sort_items(&mut vec);
        
        // Properties that must hold
        prop_assert_eq!(vec.len(), original_len); // No items lost
        prop_assert!(vec.windows(2).all(|w| w[0] <= w[1])); // Sorted
    }
}
```

### 3. Integration Tests (Interaction Verification)
**Purpose**: Verify components communicate correctly  
**Value**: Catch "works in isolation, fails together" bugs  
**When**: After unit tests prove individual correctness  
**Mutation Focus**: Return values, error propagation, data flow

### 4. Behavioral Tests (User Reality)
**Purpose**: Verify system behaves as users expect  
**Value**: Prevents "it works but users hate it"  
**When**: Define early, test throughout  
**Mutation Focus**: Business logic, user-facing calculations

## The Modern Testing Process

### What Failed: The Monolithic Approach (OCR's 0%)
1. Write all property tests across module
2. Add comprehensive integration tests  
3. Create snapshot tests for validation
4. Run mutation testing once at end
5. **Result**: 34m 50s later, discover 0% effectiveness
6. Overwhelming 234 mutations to fix
7. Give up or do massive rewrite

### What Works: Incremental Mutation-Driven Development

#### Step 1: Write Initial Test (5 min)
Start with ONE test for ONE function:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_parse_time_basic() {
    assert_eq!(parse_time("14:30"), Ok(Time::new(14, 30)));
}
```

#### Step 2: Mutation Test Immediately (5 min)
```bash
# Rust
cargo mutants --file src/parser.rs --function parse_time --timeout 30

# Python
mutmut run --paths-to-mutate parser.py --runner "pytest test_parser.py::test_parse_time"

# JavaScript
npx stryker run --mutate "src/parser.js" --testFilter "parse_time"
```

#### Step 3: Analyze What Survived
Example from OCR's 222 survived mutations:

```rust
// Mutation survived: y_sum += fy → y_sum -= fy
// Why: Test only checked result wasn't null, not correctness
// Fix: Assert actual center of mass value
```

#### Step 4: Iterate Until Effective
- Add test case for each survived mutation
- Re-run mutation testing
- Stop when >75% mutations caught
- Move to next function

## Behavioral Coverage: What Really Matters

Track what users experience, not code lines:

```yaml
# behaviors.yaml
behaviors:
  - id: parse-race-time
    description: "Parse HH:MM:SS race times correctly"
    tested: true
    mutation_score: 85%  # From targeted mutation testing
    
  - id: handle-edge-pose
    description: "Detect edge cases in rider pose"
    tested: true
    mutation_score: 0%   # OCR lesson - looks tested, isn't
```

## Real-World Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Code Movement Between Test Runs
**Problem**: Start mutation testing, refactor code, mutations reference old locations  
**Solution**: 
- Tag code before mutation testing: `git tag pre-mutation`
- Use incremental approach (fewer mutations active at once)

### Challenge 2: Overwhelming Results
**Problem**: 234 mutations like OCR, don't know where to start  
**Solution**: 
- Focus on critical paths first (user-facing calculations)
- Skip low-value targets (logging, simple getters)

## Time Investment Reality

Accept these timelines as normal and necessary:

- **Per function**: 15-30 minutes (write test, mutate, improve)
- **Per module**: 1-2 hours (comprehensive testing)
- **Mutation testing run**: 30 min - 4 hours (run in background with nohup)
- **Full analysis**: 4-5 hours including mapping code movement

This is NOT slow. This is building quality.

### The Natural Test Litmus Test

From real experience testing 5 functions:
1. Can you write a test in < 5 minutes?
2. Do test cases feel like real scenarios?
3. Are assertions obvious, not contrived?

If NO to any → **Stop and refactor the code first**

## Practical Execution Guide

### Running Mutation Testing in Background
```bash
# Tag your code first (critical for mapping movements)
git tag pre-mutation-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Run in background with logging
nohup cargo mutants --file src/module.rs \
    --jobs 8 --timeout 180 \
    > mutation_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress
tail -f mutation_*.log | grep -E "MISSED|CAUGHT|tested"
```

### When to Run Full vs Incremental
- **During development**: Single function (5 min)
- **Before commit**: Module level (30 min)
- **Before release**: Full codebase (2-4 hours)

- Use bats for testing (example in MODERN_TESTING_STRATEGY.md)
- Manual mutation analysis (change && to ||, < to >)
- Focus on error handling paths and edge cases
```

## What NOT to Test (From Experience)

Based on analysis of functions that resist unit testing:

### 1. Simple Delegators
```rust
fn get_name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }  // Don't unit test
```

### 2. Pure Type Conversions
```rust
impl From<ConfigError> for AppError { ... }  // Test at integration level
```

### 3. Framework Boilerplate
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize)]  // Framework handles this
```

### 4. Simple Logging/Metrics
```rust
info!("Processing item: {}", id);  // Not worth testing
```

## When Mutation Testing is REQUIRED

**ALWAYS** after writing tests for:
1. **Mathematical calculations** - Any arithmetic can have wrong operators
2. **Business logic with conditions** - if/else branches hide bugs
3. **Parsing/validation functions** - Edge cases lurk everywhere
4. **Any refactoring of tested code** - Ensure behavior preserved

**The Magic Question**: Before saying "tests are complete", ask:
*"What would mutation testing reveal?"*

If unsure, RUN IT. The answer might be 0%.

## The Three Universal Truths

### 1. Mutation Testing During Development, Not After
- Old: Write all tests → Run mutations → Despair at 0%
- New: Write test → Mutate → Fix → Repeat

### 2. Natural Tests Reveal Good Design
- Easy to test = Well designed code
- Hard to test = Refactor before testing
- Contrived tests = Future bugs

### 3. Coverage Grows Through Usage
- Ship at 60-70% with quality tests
- Let users find edge cases
- Add regression tests for real failures
- 90%+ coverage emerges naturally

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Mock-Everything Anti-Pattern
```python
# BAD: Tests the mocks, not the code
def test_process():
    mock_db = Mock()
    mock_api = Mock()
    mock_cache = Mock()
    # ... 50 lines of mock setup
    assert mock_db.called  # Tests mocks!
```

### The Snapshot-Everything Anti-Pattern
```javascript
// BAD: Captures bugs as "correct"
test('renders correctly', () => {
    const tree = renderer.create(<Component />).toJSON();
    expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();  // Locks in current bugs
});
```

### The 100% Coverage Obsession
```rust
// BAD: Contrived test for coverage
#[test]
fn test_debug_impl() {
    let obj = MyStruct::new();
    format!("{:?}", obj);  // Pointless
}
```

## Red Flags: Your Tests Are Bad If...

### From OCR's 0% Effectiveness Analysis

1. **Structure-Only Assertions**
   ```rust
   // BAD - Survived all mutations
   assert!(result.is_some());
   assert!(!vec.is_empty());
   
   // GOOD - Catches mutations
   assert_eq!(result, Some(42));
   assert_eq!(vec.len(), 3);
   ```

2. **Property Tests Without Properties**
   ```rust
   // BAD - From OCR module
   proptest! {
       fn test_parse(s in any::<String>()) {
           let _ = parse(&s); // Just checking it doesn't panic
       }
   }
   
   // GOOD - Actually tests properties
   proptest! {
       fn test_parse_valid(h in 0..24u8, m in 0..60u8) {
           let input = format!("{}:{:02}", h, m);
           let result = parse(&input).unwrap();
           prop_assert_eq!(result.hour, h);
           prop_assert_eq!(result.minute, m);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Tests That Test Nothing**
   ```rust
   // BAD - From OCR's failed tests
   let telemetry = extract_telemetry(&img)?;
   assert!(telemetry.speed.is_some());
   
   // GOOD - Verifies actual values
   assert_eq!(telemetry.speed, Some(34.2));
   assert!((telemetry.distance.unwrap() - 6.4).abs() < 0.1);
   ```

4. **The "Test Takes Forever to Write" Signal**
   - If a test takes > 5 minutes to write, the code design is fighting you
   - Example: OCR's nested functions made testing individual parts nearly impossible
   - Solution: Refactor first, then test

## Quick Start Checklist

When starting any new code:
1. [ ] Write one unit test with concrete assertions
2. [ ] Run mutation testing on just that function
3. [ ] If any mutations survive, improve test immediately
4. [ ] Only then move to next function
5. [ ] Build up to integration tests only after units are solid

## The Meta-Lesson

The OCR module didn't just have bad tests - it revealed a broken process:
- Writing tests without validation
- Prioritizing variety over verification  
- Avoiding the "difficult and long-winded" truth

This guide changes that. Mutation testing isn't a final validation - it's an integral part of writing tests that actually work.
