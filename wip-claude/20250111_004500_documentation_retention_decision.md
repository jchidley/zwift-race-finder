# Documentation Retention Decision

## Files Created This Session

During this analysis session, we created 9 temporary documentation files. Here's the retention decision for each:

## KEEP (4 files)

### 1. `20250111_001000_claude_md_overlap_analysis.md` ✓
**Why Keep**: Critical reference showing exactly what's in each parent CLAUDE.md
- Details what's covered in Global CLAUDE.md
- Details what's covered in Tools CLAUDE.md  
- Identifies unique project content
- Essential for avoiding future duplication

### 2. `20250111_001500_claude_md_final_refactoring_plan.md` ✓
**Why Keep**: The actionable implementation plan
- Exact new CLAUDE.md structure (~200 lines)
- Lists all files to create
- Specifies what content goes where
- Ready to execute

### 3. `20250111_003500_reverse_update_plan_expanded.md` ✓
**Why Keep**: Comprehensive plan for updating parent docs
- All 8 categories of insights discovered
- Specific text to add to parent files
- Priority implementation phases
- Documents valuable LLM development patterns

### 4. `20250111_002500_testing_evolution_differences.md` ✓
**Why Keep**: Important context on testing evolution
- Explains WHY this project's insights are newer
- Shows concrete examples of improvement
- Justifies the reverse update need
- Historical record of discovery progression

## REMOVE (5 files)

### 1. `20250111_000100_claude_md_refactoring_plan.md` ✗
**Why Remove**: Superseded by revised plan
- Initial plan before parent analysis
- Missing critical context
- Replaced by final plan

### 2. `20250111_000100_claude_md_refactoring_plan_revised.md` ✗
**Why Remove**: Superseded by final plan
- Intermediate revision
- Still lacked parent analysis
- Content incorporated in final

### 3. `20250111_002000_reverse_update_plan_testing_insights.md` ✗
**Why Remove**: Superseded by expanded version
- Only covered testing insights
- Expanded plan includes all 8 categories
- Content fully incorporated

### 4. `20250111_003000_claude_md_revision_summary.md` ✗
**Why Remove**: Superseded by complete analysis
- Interim summary
- Less comprehensive than final
- Content captured elsewhere

### 5. `20250111_004000_complete_overlap_analysis_summary.md` ✗
**Why Remove**: Redundant with other kept files
- High-level summary only
- Details exist in kept files
- No unique actionable content

## Summary

**Keep 4 files** that provide:
- Reference material (overlap analysis)
- Actionable plans (refactoring, reverse update)
- Important context (testing evolution)

**Remove 5 files** that are:
- Superseded versions
- Interim work
- Redundant summaries

## Recommended Action

```bash
# Remove superseded files
rm wip-claude/20250111_000100_claude_md_refactoring_plan.md
rm wip-claude/20250111_000100_claude_md_refactoring_plan_revised.md
rm wip-claude/20250111_002000_reverse_update_plan_testing_insights.md
rm wip-claude/20250111_003000_claude_md_revision_summary.md
rm wip-claude/20250111_004000_complete_overlap_analysis_summary.md

# Kept files remain as valuable reference:
# - 20250111_001000_claude_md_overlap_analysis.md
# - 20250111_001500_claude_md_final_refactoring_plan.md
# - 20250111_003500_reverse_update_plan_expanded.md
# - 20250111_002500_testing_evolution_differences.md
```

## Rationale

This retention strategy keeps only files that:
1. Provide unique reference value
2. Contain actionable plans
3. Document important evolution/context
4. Aren't superseded by later versions

The 4 kept files give you everything needed to:
- Execute the CLAUDE.md refactoring
- Update parent documentation 
- Understand the context and reasoning
