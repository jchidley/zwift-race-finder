# Zwift Height/Weight Requirements Research

## Executive Summary

Zwift exists in a philosophical tension between being a "game" and a "training/racing platform." While casual users can treat height/weight as adjustable game parameters, competitive racing requires strict accuracy with verification and significant consequences for manipulation.

## Official Requirements

### Platform Minimums
- **Minimum weight**: 100 lbs (45 kg) - implemented to prevent extreme weight doping
- **Height/Weight privacy**: No longer displayed publicly (except on ZwiftPower) to prevent harassment

### Casual Riding
- No strict requirement to use real height/weight
- Can be treated as "difficulty slider in a game"
- No verification or enforcement for non-competitive riding

### Competitive Racing Requirements

#### Elite Events (Zwift World Series, Zwift Academy)
- **Weight**: Must be entered in kg to nearest 0.1kg
- **Height**: Must be entered to nearest 1cm
- **Verification**: Video proof required within specific timeframes
- **Documentation**: 14+ days prior submission of:
  - Public Strava data
  - FIT files for all-time power bests (5s to 20min)
  - Smart trainer equipment photos and models
  - Weight/height verification videos

#### WTRL and Community Racing
- Random height verification videos required
- ZwiftPower tracks all height history changes
- Significant changes flagged for review

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Detection Systems
1. **ZADA (Zwift Accuracy and Data Analysis)**
   - Automated detection of impossible performances
   - Thresholds: 5.2 w/kg for 20min or 6.0 w/kg for 5min
   - Manual review of flagged cases (10-40 hours/week volunteer work)

2. **Community Monitoring**
   - Zwift Transparency Facebook group
   - Video weigh-in protocols
   - Peer reporting system

### Penalty Structure

#### Tier 2 Violations (Deliberate height/weight manipulation)
- 1st offense: Event/series disqualification
- 2nd offense: Extended ban
- 3rd offense: Up to 1-year ban from Zwift esports

#### Tier 3 Violations (Data fabrication/modification)
- 1st offense: 6-month ban minimum
- 3rd offense: Lifetime ban possible

#### Other Penalties
- 30-day shadow ban (invisible to other users)
- ZADA adjustment (power scaled to match real output)
- Removal from results/rankings

## Game vs Simulation Philosophy

### "It's Just a Game" Perspective
- "It is, after all, cartoon racing, right?"
- "I'll never understand how anyone can take cartoon racing so seriously enough to cheat"
- Height/weight as difficulty adjustments for training purposes

### "It's Serious Competition" Perspective
- Professional esports with prize money
- Official UCI cycling esports championships
- Career opportunities for professional racers
- Training tool for real-world performance

### Community Division
- Survey: 46% admitted to "cheating" at least once
- Only 12% think cheating common among friends
- 60% believe cheating common in general
- 87% of men, 91% of women report accurate height/weight

## Performance Impact

### Weight Effects
- 1kg reduction = ~45 seconds saved on Alpe du Zwift
- 1kg reduction = ~9 seconds saved per hour on flat courses

### Height Effects  
- Shorter riders faster at same power
- Every 15cm height reduction ≈ 5-10 watts advantage
- 5' rider ~2 minutes faster than 6' rider per hour on flat

## Professional Racer Approach

### Equipment Requirements
- Approved smart trainers only (±2% accuracy)
- Specific models: Tacx Neo 2/2T, Wahoo Kickr v5/v6, etc.

### Team Requirements
- Age 16+ with valid category
- Recent racing history (30 days)
- 4-6 riders per team event

### Verification Culture
- Accepted as necessary for fair competition
- Regular video weigh-ins standard practice
- Height/weight changes tracked and scrutinized

## Types of Manipulation

1. **Traditional Weight Doping**: Entering lower weight for higher w/kg
2. **Reverse Weight Doping**: Adding weight to stay in lower categories
3. **Mid-Race Manipulation**: Historical exploit (now patched) allowing changes during events
4. **Height Gaming**: Reducing height for aerodynamic advantage

## Key Findings

1. **Dual Nature**: Zwift functions as both casual game and serious competition platform
2. **Enforcement Varies**: Strict for elite events, minimal for casual riding
3. **Community Self-Policing**: Significant volunteer effort maintains integrity
4. **Technical Arms Race**: Ongoing battle between cheaters and detection systems
5. **Cultural Impact**: Division between casual and competitive users shapes platform evolution

## Implications for Users

### Casual Riders
- Free to adjust height/weight for training goals
- No consequences outside competitive events
- Privacy protections in place

### Competitive Racers
- Must use accurate data or face penalties
- Regular verification expected
- Community scrutiny intense
- Career/reputation consequences

### Platform Evolution
- Increasing verification requirements
- Better detection systems
- Balance between accessibility and integrity
- Ongoing philosophical tensions

## Conclusion

Zwift's height/weight requirements reflect its dual identity. While the platform allows flexibility for casual users, competitive integrity demands strict accuracy with real consequences. The community remains divided on whether Zwift is primarily a game or a legitimate sporting platform, but enforcement mechanisms clearly favor the latter for any competitive activity.
