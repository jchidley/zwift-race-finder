## What's Already Covered Elsewhere

### In Global CLAUDE.md:
- ‚úÖ Refactoring discipline
- ‚úÖ Session management
- ‚úÖ wip-claude/ documentation approach
- ‚úÖ Core behaviors (ASK, EXPLAIN, etc.)

### In Tools CLAUDE.md:
- ‚úÖ General mutation testing requirement and lesson
- ‚úÖ Testing standards and TDD
- ‚úÖ Language selection (Rust for this project)
- ‚úÖ Build tools (mask usage)
- ‚úÖ Installation standards (~/.local/bin)
- ‚úÖ Bash script standards
- ‚úÖ Source control with gh

## What MUST Stay in Project CLAUDE.md

### 1. Project-Specific Philosophy
The Human-AI collaboration model specific to Jack's domain expertise in Zwift racing is unique and essential.

### 2. The OCR 0% Lesson - PROJECT CONTEXT
While Tools CLAUDE.md has the general mutation testing lesson, this project needs:
- The specific OCR module story (property + snapshot + integration + fuzz = 0%)
- Links to project-specific mutation reports
- The exact workflow for THIS codebase

### 3. Zwift Domain Knowledge
All the Zwift-specific content is irreplaceable:
- Route systems and IDs
- Pack dynamics discoveries
- Racing Score vs Traditional categories
- Duration estimation specifics
- ZwiftPower import process

### 4. Project Commands & Workflows
- Specific cargo run examples
- Database management commands
- Import scripts usage
- Route mapping workflows

### 5. Regression Testing Strategy
Jack's actual race history and calibration approach is unique to this project.

## Revised CLAUDE.md Structure

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md - Zwift Race Finder

Project-specific guidance for Claude Code. For general standards, see:
- Global: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Tools: /home/jack/tools/CLAUDE.md

## Project Philosophy
[Keep - unique Human-AI collaboration for Zwift domain]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROJECT CRITICAL: OCR Module 0% Lesson
[Keep expanded - while general lesson is in Tools, this specific case study is vital]
- Link to COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_GUIDE.md
- Link to mutation reports in wip-claude/
- Specific commands for THIS project

## Essential Commands
[Keep - all project-specific]

## Architecture & Domain Knowledge
Brief overview with links:
- Zwift Concepts ‚Üí docs/ZWIFT_DOMAIN.md (new)
- System Design ‚Üí docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Algorithms ‚Üí docs/ALGORITHMS.md
- Database ‚Üí docs/development/DATABASE.md

## Common Tasks
[Keep brief versions with links to detailed guides]

## Project-Specific Testing
- Regression tests with Jack's race data
- Route validation approach
- Integration with Zwift APIs

## Log Management
[Keep - project-specific approach]
```

## Key Differences to Preserve

### 1. Domain Expertise Integration
This project uniquely integrates Jack's 40 years IT + Zwift racing expertise. The philosophy section captures how AI assists domain experts.

### 2. Empirical Approach
"When data contradicts descriptions, investigate" - this empirical approach led to major discoveries (Racing Score events, pack dynamics).

### 3. Historical Discoveries
The evolution of understanding (Bell Lap variance, drop dynamics, event types) provides critical context for future work.

### 4. Specific Mutation Testing Integration
While parent has general guidance, this project needs:
- `cargo mutants --file src/file.rs --function my_function`
- OCR module as cautionary tale
- Links to project mutation reports

## Recommendations

1. **Remove from Project CLAUDE.md**:
   - General refactoring rules (covered in global)
   - General testing philosophy (covered in tools)
   - Installation standards (covered in tools)
   - General development principles (covered in tools)

2. **Keep but Condense**:
   - Architecture (move details to docs/)
   - Algorithms (move details to docs/)
   - Database (move details to docs/)

3. **Keep and Emphasize**:
   - OCR 0% lesson with project context
   - Zwift domain knowledge
   - Project-specific commands
   - Regression testing approach
   - Historical discoveries summary

4. **Add Clear References**:
   - "For refactoring rules, see ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md"
   - "For testing standards, see /home/jack/tools/CLAUDE.md"
   - "For language selection, see /home/jack/tools/CLAUDE.md"

This approach eliminates duplication while preserving project-specific knowledge that Claude needs for effective assistance.
